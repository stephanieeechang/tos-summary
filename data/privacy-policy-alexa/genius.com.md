### 1\. DATA WE COLLECT

**What Personal Data Do We Collect From You?** We collect Personal Data about you when you provide such information directly to us, when third parties such as our business partners or service providers (including, but not limited to, social networks and analytics services) provide us with Personal Data about you, or when Personal Data about you is automatically collected in connection with your use of our Service. In some cases, we combine non-Personal Data about you with Personal Data we have about you.

**Information We Collect From You Directly:** We receive Personal Data directly from you when you provide us with such Personal Data, including without limitation the following:

  * **Registration:** You can browse our Website without providing Personal Data, but you must create an account in order to access some of the features of our Website. When you create an account, we collect Personal Data, such as your email address, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, user name and password and date of birth. If you take part in any interactive features of the Service (such as any contests, games, promotions, quizzes, surveys, research or other services or features), you may provide us with additional types of Personal Data. We also collect information from you if you correspond with us directly.
  * **Profile Information:** After you set up your account, you can also choose to provide additional information which is shared through public profiles. This information includes, without limitation, your user name, an avatar to represent yourself (which may or may not be a photo of you), and a personal narrative. Note that information you provide in your profile will be publicly available. If you do not wish to have information in your public profile, please do not add it.
  * **User Content:** We collect User Content you provide on the Website, and we display it publicly on your user profile. For example, your profile page can display information about the pages, artists, or works upon which you have commented. Such information may include “favorites” such as artists, songs and lines. Other users can post to a wall in this profile, where the public can view references to your comments you have made on the Website. User Content will include Personal Data if you provide Personal Data in your User Content.



**Information We Receive From Third Party Sources:** Some third parties, such as our business partners and service providers, provide us with Personal Data about you, such as the following:

  * **Information We May Receive From Social Network Sites:** If you choose to connect your social media account(s), such as Facebook or Twitter, to your user profile on the Service, we display some information from your social media sites on our Service, and such information can include Personal Data. When you interact with our Website or Service through social media platforms, including Facebook, Google, Spotify, or Twitter, such as when you login with or link to your social media account, “Like” us on Facebook or share content through a social media site, we receive information from the social network such as your profile information, profile picture, gender, user name, user ID associated with your social media account, birth date, email address, age range, language, country, friends list, and any other information you permit the social network to share with third parties. The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our Website or Service.
  * **Analytics and Advertising:** We use third-party service providers to provide site metrics and other analytics services. These third parties provide us with information regarding your behavior on our Service.

These social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Service. When you use these tools, the party that provides the tool, the third party that operates the social media services, and/or we may receive Personal Data about you. By using these tools, you acknowledge that some information, including Personal Data, from your social media services will be transmitted to us, and that information is therefore covered by this Privacy Policy, and some information, including Personal Data, may be shared with the third party services, and that information is therefore governed by their privacy policies.

Behavioral Advertising may appear on our Service or on other websites or services. We work with third parties to provide Behavioral Advertising, such as advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers, and other third-party service providers (collectively, “Advertising Service Providers”). Advertising Service Providers perform services such as facilitating targeting of advertisements and measuring and analyzing advertising effectiveness on the Service (collectively, all such services, “Targeting Services”). Targeting Services help us display Behavioral Advertising, prevent you from seeing repeated ads, and enable us to research the usefulness of ads.

  * We adhere to self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising issued by the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (“EDAA”) (collectively, the “OBA Principles”).

  * **Contractual Necessity:** We process some Personal Data as a matter of “contractual necessity”, meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Service with you, which enables us to provide you with the Service. When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Service that require such data.
  * **Legitimate Interest:** We process Personal Data for certain purposes when we believe it furthers the legitimate interest of us or others (e.g. our users). Examples of these legitimate interests include: 
    * Operation and improvement of our business and Service

    * Provision of customer support

  * **Other Processing Grounds:** From time to time we may also need to process Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.



### 2\. SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES

**How and With Whom Do We Share Your Data?**

We share your Personal Data in the instances described below. We also share information with others in an aggregated and anonymous form that does not reasonably identify you directly as an individual. For further information on your choices regarding your information, see the “Your Choices Regarding Your Data” section below.

**Remember, our Service allows you to connect with others and share information about yourself with other individuals. Your profile information, including your user name, avatar, and personal narrative, and comments you make on the Website, will be available publicly to other members of the Service by default and in some cases will be searchable by search engines which can display your information publicly.**

We also share Personal Data with vendors, third party service providers and agents who work on our behalf and provide us with services related to the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, which include providing cloud storage or hosting services, marketing assistance, email delivery, content or service fulfillment, or providing analytics services. We share Personal Data with these third parties as needed to perform services for us and under reasonable confidentiality terms. These parties include:

We would share Personal Data with third parties in connection with any company transaction, such as a merger, sale of company assets or shares, reorganization, financing, change of control or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company or third party or in the event of bankruptcy or related or similar proceedings. For example, if we choose to buy or sell assets, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Data as set forth in this policy.

We also share Personal Data with third parties for their marketing purposes if we determine they have products or services which may be of interest to you.

Our online merchant store is currently hosted by Shopify Inc. (“Shopify”). Shopify provides us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell certain merchandise to you. When you provide Personal Data in connection with a purchase on or through the Service, such Personal Data is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases, and the general Shopify application. Shopify may transfer, process or store your data outside of the United States and such data may be subject to disclosure as required by applicable law.

### 3\. YOUR CHOICES REGARDING YOUR DATA

**Marketing Communications:** If you do not want to receive promotional emails from us, you can click the “unsubscribe” button on the promotional email communications or email us at [privacy@genius.com](mailto:privacy@genius.com) with the subject “Marketing Opt-Out”. Note that you will not be able to unsubscribe or opt-out of non-promotional messages regarding your account, such as account verification, password reminders, changes or updates to features of the Service, or technical and security notices.

We share your Personal Data, such as email address and user name, with some third parties for their marketing purposes if we determine they have products or services which may be of interest to you. If you wish to have your user name and email address excluded from any such sharing with partners, please email [privacy@genius.com](mailto:privacy@genius.com) with the subject “Marketing Opt-Out.” If you have any questions about this opt-out or our marketing practices, please email us at [privacy@genius.com](mailto:privacy@genius.com).

**Behavioral Advertising and Tracking Tools:** You can opt-out of certain Behavioral Advertising activities by doing one or more of the following. Please note that you will need to opt-out of each browser and device for which you desire to apply these opt-out features.

  * **Service Provider Opt Out:** You can opt-out directly from some Advertising Service Providers and providers of Tracking Tools by using their opt-out tools. Some of these service providers, and links to their opt-out tools, are: 
    * Google Analytics: with a privacy policy at <http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/> and opt out at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.
  * **Industry Opt Out Tools:** Some Advertising Service Providers or providers of Tracking Tools may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative's (NAI) Opt-Out Tool (<http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Consumer Choice Page (<http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>), and you can opt-out of certain services and learn more about your choices by visiting the links included here. Users in the EU can visit <http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/> for more information about your choices and to opt out of participating service providers.
  * **Web Browser Controls:** You can prevent the use of certain Tracking Tools, such as cookies, on a device-by-device basis using the controls in your web browser. These controls can be found in the Tools > Internet Options (or similar) menu for your browser, or as otherwise directed by your browser’s support feature. Through your web browser, you may be able to: 
    * Delete existing Tracking Tools
    * Disable future Tracking Tools
    * Set your browser to provide you with a warning each time a cookie or certain other Tracking Tools are being set
  * **Mobile Opt Out** : Your mobile devices may offer settings that enable you to make choices about the collection, use, or transfer of mobile app information for Behavioral Advertising. You may also opt-out of certain Tracking Tools on mobile devices by installing the DAA’s AppChoice app on your mobile device (for iTunes, visit <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appchoices/id894822870?mt=8>, for Android, visit [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DAA.appchoices&hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DAA.appchoices&hl=en)). For more information, please visit <http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4228>, <https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en> or <http://www.applicationprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertising-choices-on-a-mobile-device>, as applicable.
  * **Do Not Track:** Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. The Service does not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Service and after you leave our Service. We collect certain persistent identifiers from your browser or mobile device to assist us with providing and improving the Service. Because we collect browsing and persistent identifier data (only for analytic and internal purposes), your selection of the “Do Not Track” option provided by your mobile browser will not have any effect on our collection of analytics information or the collection of a persistent identifier.



Please note the following with respect to opting out of Behavioral Advertising:

  * Some opt-out features are cookie-based, meaning that when you use these opt-out features, an “opt-out” cookie will be placed on your computer or other device indicating that you do not want to receive Behavioral Advertising from certain companies. If you delete your cookies, use a different browser, or use a different device, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.
  * Opting-out of Behavioral Advertising does not mean that you will no longer receive online ads. It only means that such ads will no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests. You may continue to see ads on and about the Service.

This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that some cookies placed by third parties can continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services.

**Data Retention:** We retain Personal Data about you for a period of time consistent with the original purpose of collection, whether or not you have an account with us. For instance, we may retain your Personal Data for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you the Service, and for a reasonable period of time afterward. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to pursue our legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, enforce our agreements, or as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. Afterwards, we retain some information in a depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a way that would identify you personally. If you wish to change or delete your profile and Personal Data, you can contact us at [privacy@genius.com](mailto:privacy@genius.com), and we will amend or delete your Personal Data within a reasonable time after your request, if feasible, or if you reside in the EU, as set forth in Section 8 below. Because of the crowd-sourced and collaborative nature of our service, however, we will not be able to delete content you post to public areas of our site. We may be able to anonymize your information such that you will no longer be reasonably identifiable.

### 4\. SECURITY AND STORAGE OF DATA

Genius cares about the security of your information and uses commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information we collect. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.

### 5\. TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA

The Service is hosted and operated in the United States (“U.S.”) through Genius and its service providers, and if you are not located in the U.S., laws in the U.S. may differ from the laws where you are located. By using the Service, you acknowledge that any Personal Data about you, regardless of whether provided by you or obtained from a third party, is being provided to Genius in the U.S. and will be hosted on U.S. servers, and you authorize Genius to transfer, store and process your information to and in the U.S., and possibly other countries. You hereby consent to the transfer of your data to the U.S. pursuant to EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, the details of which are further set forth below.

The Privacy Shield Principles require that we remain potentially liable if any third party processing Personal Data on our behalf fails to comply with these Privacy Shield Principles (except to the extent we are not responsible for the event giving rise to any alleged damage). Genius’s compliance with the Privacy Shield is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

You can visit <https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield> for more information or to file a complaint, at no cost to you. Under certain conditions, you can also be entitled to invoke binding arbitration for complaints not resolved by other means.

### 6\. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

As noted in the Terms of Service (<https://genius.com/static/terms>), we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 (or if you are in the EU, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 16). If you are under 13 (or under 16 in the EU), please do not attempt to register for the Service or send any Personal Data about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 13 (or under age 16 in the EU), we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 (or under 16 in the EU) may have provided us Personal Data, please contact us at [privacy@genius.com](mailto:privacy@genius.com). Please contact us at [privacy@genius.com](mailto:privacy@genius.com) if you have any questions about children's privacy.
