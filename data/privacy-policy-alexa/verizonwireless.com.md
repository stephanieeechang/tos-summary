# Privacy Policies | Verizon

At Verizon, we are committed to maintaining strong and meaningful privacy protections for customers. Our privacy policy is designed to inform you about the information we collect, how we use it, and your options about certain uses of information.

Verizon's privacy policy applies to website visitors and customers of the Verizon family of companies in the United States.

Verizon has acquired Yahoo and combined it with AOL to form a new company named Oath. Oath consists of over 50 digital and mobile [brands](https://www.oath.com/our-brands/) globally, including HuffPost, Yahoo News, Yahoo Sports, Tumblr, and AOL, as well as advertising platforms such as ONE by AOL, BrightRoll, and Gemini. Oath and Yahoo each have their own privacy policies. In the event of a conflict between the Verizon privacy policy and the Oath or Yahoo privacy policies, the [Oath policy](http://privacy.aol.com/) will control when you use a site, product or service that links to the Oath privacy policy and the [Yahoo privacy policy](https://policies.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.htm) will apply when you use a site, service, or technology that links to the Yahoo policy.

Supplemental privacy practices applicable to certain Verizon apps, Hum, go90 and other services are available from the privacy policy pages.

Below, we've summarized key elements from our [full privacy policy](http://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy) for your convenience.
