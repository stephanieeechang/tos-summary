**Your Rights & the EU General Data Protection Act**

We are committed to GDPR compliance when enforcement begins on May 25, 2018. If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, you have the following rights with respect to data for which Clicksor is the Data Controller:

1\. The right to request access to, or ask us to provide you with copies of, Personal Data that we hold about you at any time, which may be subject to a fee specified by law for processing your request (but not for making a request for access). If Clicksor is the Data Controller with respect to your data, we will respond to your request within a reasonable period, and if Clicksor is the Data Processor with respect to your data, we may redirect your request to Clicksor’s customer acting as the Data Controller with respect to your data. We may decline a request for access to Personal Data in circumstances prescribed by relevant privacy laws. If we decline a request, we will provide you with a written notice that sets out the reasons for the refusal (unless it would be unreasonable to provide those reasons) and provide you with a statement regarding the mechanisms available to you to make a complaint;  
2\. The right to ask us to delete any Personal Data that we hold about you free of charge, unless we are required to maintain a copy of this data pursuant to applicable law;  
3\. The right to ask us to update and correct any out-of-date or incorrect or inaccurate Personal Data that we hold about you free of charge. We will take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate, complete and up to date. If we refuse to correct your Personal Data, we will provide you with a written notice that sets out the reasons for our refusal (unless it would be unreasonable to provide those reasons) and provide you with a statement regarding the mechanisms available to you to make a complaint;  
4\. The right to opt out of any marketing communications that we (or any third-party to whom we have disclosed your Personal Data with your consent) may send you or to withdraw your prior consent or object to any further processing of your Personal Data;  
5\. The right to request information about any automated decisions made using your Personal Data that have legal consequences for you or which significantly affect you; and  
6\. The right to lodge a complaint with your local Data Protection Authority concerning Clicksor’s processing of your Personal Data.

If you wish to exercise any of the above rights, send us an email at privacy@Clicksor.com headed “Data Subject Request.” Before we process any request, we may ask you for certain Personal Data to verify your identity, and in situations where Clicksor is the Data Processor, consult with the Data Controller of your data. Where permitted by local law, we may reject requests that are unreasonable or impractical. Please allow us a reasonable time to respond to your inquiries and requests.
