For privacy and security reasons, we do not provide online access for members to their personal information.

You may request that we delete your Personal Information by “deleting your account” in your my Account page.

Despite the foregoing and even though you have requested us to remove information, we will retain in our files certain data such as information used to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, comply with credit card merchant banking and association agreements, enhance security, reduce fraud, comply with Federal and State law, or to enforce any agreements, policies, and rules governing your use of our website.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
