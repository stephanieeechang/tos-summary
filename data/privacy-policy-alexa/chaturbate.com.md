## Cookies Policy

You should be aware that when you use the Site we may collect information using cookies or similar technologies.

### What are cookies and how do they work?

Cookies are small files that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Your browser sends these cookies back to the website every time you visit the site again, so it can recognize you. This allows websites to tailor what you see on the screen.

### Do we use other technologies which are similar to cookies?

Our websites, apps and emails often contain small invisible images known as 'web beacons' or 'tracking pixels'. These are used in a way similar to cookies, to understand when a particular part of a webpage is viewed. Our apps often use device identifiers in the same way as cookies. A device identifier is a unique number on your device which allow us to remember your device.

### What do we use cookies for?

Cookies make using websites much smoother and affect lots of the useful features of websites. There are many different uses for cookies, but they fall into four main groups:

  1. Cookies that are needed to provide the service you have asked for. Some cookies are essential so you can move around the website and use its features. Without these cookies, services you've asked for can't be provided. These cookies gather information about you that can be used for remembering your browsing history or allowing you to stay logged in during your visit.
  2. Cookies used to improve your browsing experience. These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make, such as your language or region and they provide improved features such as content provider recommendations and limiting the number of times a particular advertisement is shown to you.
  3. Cookies used to understand how people use our products and services. This allows us to keep track of what pages are popular to help other users find such pages.
  4. Cookies used to show advertising that is relevant to you based upon your viewing history.



We also use cookies in order to know how many advertisements we serve, how many times these are clicked or hovered over with a mouse cursor, how many advertisements we show to a given user and how many customer actions these generate.

We may also use cookies on the Site and advertisers' sites to understand which customers reach a sale or other action page on an advertiser's site. This allows us to monitor how effective our advertising is.

Some of our web pages will contain promotional links to other companies' sites. If you follow one of these links and then register with or buy something from that other site, a cookie is sometimes used to tell that other site that you came from one of our sites. That other site may then pay us a small amount for the successful referral. You will need to review the privacy policy of any website whose advertisement you click on as this Policy only applies to pages on our domain.
