You should also be aware that Members may reveal other personal information while communicating on other areas of the Friendster website, e.g., while participating in discussions on Friendster Groups, Forums, Chats and/or posting information on Friendster pages.

  * When the Member invites a friend via email to become a Friendster Member,
  * When we send notifications to the Member relating to his or her use of the Friendster service or Friendster website, and
  * If the Member so chooses, when we send regular notifications, weekly updates, or other news regarding the Friendster service or the Friendster website.



Except when inviting or adding friends or as otherwise expressly set forth herein, a Member's email address will never be shared with or displayed to any other person. Members and their friends, and other Members within their personal networks communicate on Friendster with each other through the Friendster service, without disclosing email addresses.
