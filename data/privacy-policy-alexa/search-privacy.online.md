### Does SearchPrivacy collect any PII?

Unless specifically provided to us, SearchPrivacy does not collect any 'Personally identifiable information' (PII). We do not for example collect any social security numbers, insurance plan numbers or precise geographical location. We strives to deliver a complete private search experience, without compromising on the quality of search results which you expect from your current search engine of choice.

We ensure this by 

  * Not asking you for any personal information: There is no signup process to get started and we never get to know your email address, your name or any other personal information. Unless provided on a contact form.
  * Not building any profile based on what you search: To ensure your complete privacy, we do not build any interest profile based on what you search for.
  * Not indulging in search filtering: Most of the search engines use the profile they build on you to filter search results. This means two different users might see different search results for the same search term. SearchPrivacy makes sure each user sees the complete search results at all times.
  * Not accessing your browsing history: We simply do not ever get access to your browsing history. This means there is no accidental possibility of us identifying you, ever.
  * Automatically protecting you from search engines that track you: Our browser extension redirects any search which you accidently perform on unsecure search engines to SearchPrivacy to always keep your searches private.
  * Not leaking your search terms to any other site: All your clicks on our search results page redirect via our own servers, which means the site you eventually visit does not get to know what you searched for.
