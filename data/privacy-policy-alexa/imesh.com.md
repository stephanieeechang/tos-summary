Welcome to iMesh. We want you to know that we respect your privacy and that we value your business. This privacy statement covers the iMesh software and the iMesh website ([www.imesh.com](https://web.archive.org/)). In order to ensure your privacy we want you to know the details of what information we collect and what we do with it.

INFORMATION COLLECTION

iMesh takes your privacy very seriously. In order to provide you with the highest quality service, we do collect certain information from you in accordance with the following guidelines.

Direct Submissions:

In order to provide you with excellent service and a superior customer experience iMesh has several areas where you can submit information to us and we also have features that automatically collect information from users of our service. Some of the information you may choose to provide includes personally identifiable information such as your name, address, email, age, gender and interests. In addition, we may collect information linked to your communications preferences, your payment and billing information, your searches and purchases, music you own, your music listening preferences, your library, play lists, most played artists and other requested information on surveys that are presented to you.

Cookies and Other Technology:

iMesh may use cookies or other technologies for several purposes all designed to improve the customer experience. Within the iMesh service we may use either what are commonly called temporary or "session" cookies as well as permanent or "persistent" cookies. Temporary or "session" cookies mean that they only last as long as you are online. We may use these cookies to identify you as a valid member so that we can deliver music to you, and to help us personalize your service experience based on your registration preferences (such as genre choice, your connection speed, your preference with regard to receiving songs that contain explicit lyrics and the country you live in), and to tailor the content and ads you receive. We may also use session cookies to help us facilitate any promotions or surveys that we provide. Within the site, we may also use session cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. These cookies do not contain any personally identifying information and we do not store data collected by them.

We may as part of the sign-in process for our service or within our shopping module, use what are commonly called "persistent" cookies which stay with you after your session is over and you are offline. We may use these cookies in connection with a sign-in feature that allows you to save your member name and password so that the next time you sign in, these fields will be pre-populated for you. If we make this cookie available, it can only be activated if you select that option during your sign-in. If you select that option you can always deselect it each time you sign-in.

We may sometimes use cookies, as well as other tracking technology, such as web beacons, within the promotional emails that we send to our members or advertisements for our service or sites. These technologies help us track, for example, whether an e-mail recipient has completed an event, such as signing up for a trial. The generated information is related to non-personally identifiable customer identification numbers and is only analyzed at aggregate levels. We may send these emails via third-party service providers that act on our behalf.

While you download and install iMesh, Web beacons may be used to monitor your progress through the installation process. These Web beacons are used to identify and correct problems with the installer program and to improve the installation process.

We sometimes utilize third party service providers to help us track the activity and user flows within our service or sites. These third parties may use temporary cookies and/or web beaconing technology to facilitate such tracking. Such tracking would track an individual user's movements but the data would not be tracked in a personally identifiable way. Such data would be stored and analyzed on an aggregated basis for purposes of internal analysis by iMesh to continue to optimize our customer experience.

If we engage with any advertising partners and or other third parties, our approved advertising partners and third parties whose products or services are promoted on our site may also use cookies, and we advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other privacy practices if you are presented with one of their offers during your association with iMesh.

Log Files and IP addresses:

We use internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, geographical location and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked by iMesh to personally identifiable information and are not kept after the statistics are logged in the aggregated database. The information we collect is used for internal review and is then discarded. It is not shared with other organizations. However, users should be aware that both static and dynamic IP addresses can be mapped back to users on most ISPs based on the users login time and recorded information.

INFORMATION USE

Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose any information about you outside of iMesh and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent.

We may share non-personally identifiable information about our users with our partners and advertisers. In addition, there are times where it may be advantageous for iMesh to make certain personally identifiable information about you available to companies that iMesh has a strategic relationship with or that perform work in conjunction with the user experience. These companies may provide services such as those that fulfill customer service orders, those that extend credit, deliver products and or ancillary services to you, enhance and manage customer data, conduct market research for iMesh. In addition, on occasion we allow you to choose to share your personal information with select iMesh partners so that they can contact you about their products, services or offers. These companies are also required to protect your personal information in accordance with iMesh's policies. Without our ability to integrate and share with these strategic partners it would be difficult for you to purchase and utilize iMesh products and services, receive the appropriate quality and level of customer service and provide us the data needed to best improve our products and services.

In addition, by providing your email address, you'll receive our weekly email newsletter and account updates, sent to you by iMesh. You can always opt out from any iMesh communication.

Some iMesh services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both iMesh and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personally identifiable information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

In an endeavor to improve the customer experience we may also purchase marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing user database, to better target our features, services and offers in which we think you may be interested. To enrich our profiles of existing customers, we may tie this information to personally identifiable information that you have given to us.

If you believe that iMesh has charged you in error, you must contact us within 60 days of the charge being billed to your account, either by clicking on the support link in the iMesh website ([http://support.imesh.com](http://support.imesh.com/)) or click on "Contact support" in iMesh application.

iMesh reserves the right to refuse your refund request if iMesh reasonably believes (i) that you are attempting to exploit this refund policy in violation of these terms, for example, by making repetitive refund requests in respect of the same Product; (ii) if you are in breach of these terms or (iii) if iMesh reasonably suspects that you are using our Products or Software fraudulently or in contravention of these terms or that your User Account is being used by a third party fraudulently.

All payments made prior to termination as provided herein, including any advance charge or payment for the subscription term during which you terminate your subscription, are nonrefundable. Termination of your subscription shall not relieve you of any obligations to pay accrued charges.

Cancellation notice:

Please note that canceling your subscription (whether by email to us or in writing) will be performed through the iMesh helpdesk by our ticketing system. Helpdesk hours are from Monday - Friday between 9am â€“ 5pm (EST) (excluding federal U.S. holidays). Please be aware that if you open a support ticket, the ticket processing will commence 2 business days (i.e, 48 hours) after the opening time/date stamp of the ticket (U.S. weekdays days only), and iMesh deems the "receipt" of your ticket to be 48 hours after the ticket is opened. If you choose to cancel your subscription, your subscription cancellation will be effective after the end of ticket processing.

You have the right to regrets for purchasing your subscription. Our cooling-off policy rule gives you three days to cancel purchases and received a full refund extends until midnight of the third business day after the sale.

In addition to the foregoing, we may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on iMesh; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of iMesh (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of iMesh services or members of the public.

LINKS

In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, we may choose various third party web sites to link from or frame within the iMesh website. We also participate in co-branding, advertising and other relationships to offer e-commerce and other services and features to our users. Information about you may be visible to subsequent websites if you link off of the iMesh website. However, even if the third party is affiliated with us, we have no control over these linked sites, each of which has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of us. Data collected by our co-brand partners, advertisers or third party web sites (even if offered on or through our site) is not received by us. As such, we are not responsible for, or have any control over, the content or the privacy policies of those third party websites, and encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited when linking from imesh.com. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by iMesh.
