# LiveJournal Privacy Policy

LiveJournal Inc. takes your privacy seriously. We are committed to making best efforts to protect your personal information and to give you as much control as possible over the privacy of the content you post on the Service. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) applies to the LiveJournal Service worldwide (the “Service”), but may not cover the content you share with third party advertisers, web developers, or service providers that may appear on the Service, or support LiveJournal products or services, which are subject to their respective privacy policies.

**Safe Harbor Principles:** LiveJournal is a social media platform that hosts user-generated content. LiveJournal does not control, condone, endorse, or assume responsibility for any of the content posted by our users. LiveJournal complies with the <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/> U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Program, and is committed to resolving complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.  European Union citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact LiveJournal at:

  * LiveJournal, Inc.

## Account and Profile Information

**Registration:** LiveJournal collects certain personal information when you register for the Service, including your name, date of birth, contact information (collectively, “identifiable personal information”). We ask for your date of birth in order to verify that you are over 13 years of age, but you are free to hide your date of birth or just the year you were born as well as all other identifiable personal information that you do not wish to share.

**Profile:** You are encouraged to provide as much non-identifiable personal information as you like once you register for the Service, including your interests, schools, and other biographical data. This will help you find friends and communities on the Service. LiveJournal will not resell your identifiable personal information to third parties. We may, however, aggregate and share generalized data and demographic information about you, such as your age, gender, geographic region, and analytical data describing your use of, and interaction with, any part of the Service, including, but not limited to, third party products, services, sponsored contests, sweepstakes, and advertisements.

**Transactions:** LiveJournal may collect and retain records regarding purchases you make on the Service as well as transactions involving third party products, services, and other offerings.

**Browser:** LiveJournal automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookies, and the pages you request.

## How We Use IP Addresses

LiveJournal may occasionally obtain IP addresses from users, depending upon how you access the Service. By posting to another user’s Journal or a Community, you may display your IP address, depending on the settings of that Journal or Community. IP addresses, browser, and session information may be used for a variety of reasons, including to:

  * Diagnose and prevent service or technology problems reported by our users or engineers.
  * Estimate the number of users visiting LiveJournal from various geographic regions.
  * Track public and internal access to content, services, and/or resources.
  * Monitor and prevent fraud, Spam, and abuse.
  * Deliver more relevant advertisements to you.

You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. If you configure your browser to reject cookies, however, you may not be able to use some LiveJournal or third party products or services.

Users who are over 18 years of age and who register as being under 18 years of age may be suspended without notice. Users who are under 18 years of age and who register as being over 18 years of age may be suspended without notice. Any content that is determined to have been posted by a user who was under 13 at the time of posting will also be deleted. We will not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13, and any information inadvertently gathered will be promptly deleted.
