We understand that your privacy is important to you, and we are committed to being transparent about the information we collect and process upon your use of our websites. This Privacy Policy describes our practices concerning the personal information collected, processed and stored by AMG when you visit and use websites operated by AMG (“Sites”). 

**If you are accessing the ask.com site via a downloadable application, you are using a service offered by AMG’s affiliated business[Ask Applications](https://apps.ask.com/) and [this privacy policy](https://eula.mindspark.com/privacypolicy/) is applicable.**

Below we describe what information we collect when you use our Sites, how we protect that information, how long we retain it, with whom we share it, and what your privacy options are. By using the Sites, you consent to our collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Information about our use of cookies and how you can change your cookie settings can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20191231191113id_/https%3A//www.ask.com/cookies). 

1) INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE

AMG operates the Site from the United States of America and, regardless of your place of residence or access location, your use of the Sites is governed by the laws of the State of California, USA. Users who access or use the Sites from other locations consent to the transfer and processing of their data in the United States of America and any other jurisdiction throughout the world. 

This Privacy Policy is provided in English. Translations to certain other languages may be available and can be requested by contacting us [here](https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us). 

Our Sites are intended for general audiences over the age of 16 years old. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16 years old. IF YOU ARE NOT AT LEAST 16 YEARS OLD, DO NOT USE THE SERVICES. 

We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy against new technologies, applicable laws, business practices, and our user’s needs, and may make changes accordingly. Please check this page periodically for updates. If we make any material changes, we will post the updated Privacy Policy here, along with its effective date, and notify you by email or by means of a notice on the Sites. Except in connection with updates that materially change the ways in which we process your information, your continued use of the Services after our posting of changes to this Privacy Policy means that you agree to be bound by such changes. We will provide notice in advance of the effective date with regard to any updates that materially change the ways in which we process your personal information. 

The Sites may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy practices. 

2) INFORMATION COLLECTED AND MEANS OF COLLECTION

 

We collect information about you from you directly providing it to us (e.g., when you contact us), from cookies and other tracking technologies that automatically collect information in the course of your use of the Sites (Learn more about these trackers in our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20191231191113id_/https%3A//www.ask.com/cookies)) and we may also collect information about you from third parties with whom we contract. 

**Information you provide directly to us.** Access to web search results or other general content on our Sites does not require you to provide us any identification (e.g., name, date of birth), contact (e.g., email address, phone number) and/or account (username and password) information. 

You may provide personal information to us, if you choose to request to receive certain communications from us, submit a help request, a customer service inquiry or other inquiry to us, or contact us about employment opportunities posted on the Sites. 

There is no need to provide to us, and we strongly discourage you from, providing any personally identifiable or sensitive information about you or anyone else including, details about your exact location, physical or mailing address, telephone number, race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership or information about your health. 

**Information collected via automated technologies and interactions.** As you interact with the Sites, we may collect information via automated means about your browser, you computer or device, your preference settings, your location and your activities, including: 

  * IP address of your computer (which helps us identify your general location);
  * Technical information about your computer or mobile device such as type of device, mobile device ID number, screen resolution, web browser information and operating system or platform;
  * Your preferences and settings (time zone, language, etc.);
  * Internet provider or mobile carrier name;
  * The URL of the webpage you were visiting when clicking to our Site;
  * Information about your activity on the Services (e.g., your search queries, mis-formatted DNS entries, search results selected, clicks, pages viewed, search history, comments, time spent on our Sites, return visits). 



Third-parties who provide us with products and services may also place cookies, ad tags and/or beacons that collect the information outlined above in order to provide us with products and services including: 

  * Analytics tools (e.g., [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics)) allowing us to analyze the performance of our Services;
  * Service features and functionalities such as those that enable videos to be played and you to connect to your social media accounts;
  * Advertisers and ad networks allowing the delivery of targeted advertisements.



These third parties may also collect information about you from other sources and combine it with other information collected about you from third party websites not affiliated with us. For example, advertiser and advertising networks, as well as data analytics companies who service them, may participate in online behavioral advertising and track your activity across various sites and/or devices where they display ads and record your activities, so they can show ads that they consider relevant to you. Where necessary, we will obtain your consent for these activities. 

Do Not Track (DNT) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. However, our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20191231191113id_/https%3A//www.ask.com/cookies) provides information and opt-out links to help you can control the collection of information about you on our Sites.

  * Social Media Platforms. The social media features in the Sites (like the Facebook “Like” or “Share” button) may allow the third-party social media providers to collect your IP address, which page of the Sites you’re visiting, and other information relating to your use of our Sites, and to set a cookie to enable such social sharing feature. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the social sharing platform. 



We require all third parties to respect your privacy and to treat your information in accordance with the law. We only permit third parties to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our agreements with them.

In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US or the Swiss-US Privacy Shield, AMG is potentially liable.

6) SECURITY

We take the security of your information seriously and use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. We also limit access to information about you to employees who reasonably need access to it to provide products or services to you, or in order to do their jobs. However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we may have collected from or about you. 

7) RETENTION

We retain the information we collect about and from you for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose we collected it for and for the purpose of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information we process, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your information, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. 

In some circumstances we may aggregate and de-identify your information in such a way that you may not reasonably be re-identified by us or any other company in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. 

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see ACCESS, REVIEW, REVISION & DELETION RIGHTS below for further information.

8) ACCESS, REVIEW, REVISION & DELETION RIGHTS

If you would like to access, review, revise or delete personal information we have collected from you, please contact us [here](https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us).Your specific rights regarding access, review, revision or deletion your information is prescribed by local laws. Specific applicable local laws may be outlined below.

**Note regarding Search Results**. Our search results list and link to content that exits on web pages that are most likely not owned or controlled by us and the same or similar results are likely available through other search engines (e.g., Google, Yahoo! etc.). If content about you is included in search results displayed on our Sites, it only means that the information exists on the Internet and it doesn’t mean that we endorse it or have the ability to remove content available on any other site and/or block such sites. To remove the content from the site linked to in the search results you should contact the owner of that site. 

**Legal rights applicable to personal data collected in the EEA**. Pursuant to the [EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation 2016/679)](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:119:TOC) (“GDPR”) natural persons (called data subjects) are afforded certain rights regarding their personal data, including the right to access, correct, delete, restrict or object to our use of, and receive a portable copy in a usable electronic format of your personal information. You also have the right to withdraw any consent that you have previously provided to us. 

If you would like to exercise any of the rights described above, and the law of your jurisdiction requires us to honor that request, please please make your request [here](https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us). To assist us in processing your request in a timely manner, please make your request in English if you are able to do so. Unless you have voluntarily provided to us any other information about you, the only information we collect and store is linked to a unique user identification number we have assigned to you via a cookie placed on your browser.

Upon submitting your request to access or delete information we store about you, please provide your User ID number. This will enable us to process your request. 

To help us prevent fraudulent removal requests, please also include a legible copy of a document that verifies your identity. You need not provide a government-issued document; a utility bill or similar mailing will suffice. Please also obscure parts of the document such as identifying numbers so long as the document continues to clearly identify you. If you are requesting the removal of search results that contain photographs of you, please ensure that the identifying document includes your photograph. If you are making the request on behalf of another person, please indicate your relationship to that person and provide evidence of your authority to make such request. All requests for removal will be reviewed by AMG’s legal and compliance team and we reserve the right, in compliance with applicable laws, to accept or reject, or make further inquiries regarding, any requests. 

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. 

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. 

We are committed to working with you to obtain a fair resolution of any complaint or concern about privacy. If, however, you believe that we have not been able to assist with your complaint or concern, you may have the right to make a complaint to the data protection authority of your country of residence.

Further, if you are receiving the Services from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in a country that is not regarded as providing the same level of protection for personal information as the laws of your home country, and may be available to the government of those countries under a lawful order made in those countries. However, whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: 

10) PRIVACY SHIELD PARTICIPATION

We comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.

Ask Media Group, LLC is further subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). 

11) CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

Under the California Civil Code, California residents have the right to request a list of all third parties to which a company conducting business in California has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that, if a company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as "unsubscribe") or opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Contact us [here](https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us), or you may contact us via regular mail at: Ask Media Group, LLC, 555 12th Street, Suite 300, Oakland, CA 94607, Attn: Your California Privacy Rights c/o Data Protection Office. All requests sent via regular mail must be labeled "Your California Privacy Rights" on the envelope or postcard and clearly stated on the actual request. For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code (your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via email. Please include your zip code for our own recordkeeping).

12) NEVADA PRIVACY RIGHTS

Under Nevada law, Nevada residents may opt out of the sale of certain “covered information” collected by operators of websites or online services. We currently do not sell covered information, as “sale” is defined by such law, and we don’t have plans to sell this information.

13) CONTACT INFORMATION

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the manner in which your information is processed (or if you are an EEA resident, how your data is transferred outside of the EEA), or if you would like to submit a request to us, please contact our Data Protection Officer [here](https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us) or via mail at:
