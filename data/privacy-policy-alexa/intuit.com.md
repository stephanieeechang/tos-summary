We do not sell or share your Personal Information with third parties for their own commercial uses without your consent.  
**

**a) Types of Information We Collect.  **In connection with accessing our Services, we may collect information from you which can be used to identify you ("Personal Information"), such as your name, shipping/billing address, email address, phone, username and password.

We collect information when you register or open an account, sign in, pay a bill, purchase a Service, call us for support, or give us feedback.  We may also get information from other companies or third parties, such as when you sync a third party account or service with your Intuit Service, or when we may use service providers to supplement the Personal Information you give us (e.g., validate your mailing address) to help us maintain the accuracy of your data and provide you with better service. Finally, we also collect content or other information that you may provide or create when you interact with our Services.

We may also automatically collect certain usage information when you access our Services ("Usage Data"), such as Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, log files, unique device identifiers, pages viewed, browser type, any links you click on to leave or interact with our Services, and other usage information collected from [cookies and other tracking technologies. ](https://security.intuit.com/index.php/privacy#COOKIES)For example, we collect IP addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information, such as using IP addresses to monitor the regions from which users navigate to our Services.  We also collect IP addresses from users when they log into the Services as part of our log-in and security features.  We may also, when you enable location-based Services, collect Global Positioning System (GPS) location data and/or motion data.

Our Services may change over time and we may introduce new features that may collect new or different types of information.

**b) How We Use Your Information.  **Unless prohibited by law, regulation, or a contractual obligation, we may use your information, including your Personal Information, for the following purposes: 

_Account Registration_. We may use your name, address, phone number, and email address to register your Intuit Account for certain [Services we provide](https://security.intuit.com/index.php/privacy#ADDITIONAL) and to communicate important information to you. We may obtain additional Personal Information about you, such as address change information, from commercially available sources, to keep our records current.  If you set up an administrator account that may be accessed by people other than you, please note that they may see and have the ability to change or delete your Personal Information.

_Communicate with You and Tell You About Other Services_.  We may use your information to communicate with you about our Services and to give you offers for third party products and services that we think may be of use to you. Please see below under "[What You Can Do to Manage Your Privacy](https://security.intuit.com/index.php/privacy#PRIVACY)" for the choices you have regarding these communications.

 _Customer Service and Technical Support_.  We may use your name, address, phone number, email address, how you interact with our Services, and information about your computer configuration to resolve questions you may have about our Services and to follow up with you about your experience.  We also offer various Internet chat services, for example, to speak with an Intuit support representative or tax advisor.  Internet Chat transmissions are encrypted but you should not supply more Personal Information, including tax data, than is required to address  your specific issue.  A transcript of the session is retained to resolve questions or issues related to our Services.

 _Feedback_. We may use any information you volunteer in surveys you answer for us and combine them with answers from other customers in order to better understand our Services and how we may improve them.  Answering any survey is optional.

Only in a way that would not allow you or any other person to be identified, we may prepare and share information about our customers with third parties, such as advertisers or partners, for research, academic, marketing and/or promotional purposes.  For example, we may share demographic data that describes the percentage of our customers who use mobile services or who use a particular operating system. We or our third party partners may publicly report the aggregated findings of the research or analysis, but only in a way that would not allow you or any other person to be identified.

Some Services may require added security and you may be asked to provide additional information.  The email address and password that you use to sign up for an Intuit account are your "credentials" that you will use to authenticate with our network.  We assign a unique ID number to your credentials to track you and your associated information.  Intuit Services do not allow sharing of accounts between users or individuals.

**d ) How We Share Your Personal Information. **From time to time, we may need to share your Personal Information with others.

We work with other companies or developers to offer you products and services and you may choose to sync, link or connect other third party services with your Intuit Service.  Sometimes Intuit may let you know about the service or product, or another company may let you know about  an Intuit service or product.  It will be clear who is referring the service or product, and who is providing the service or product.  If you choose to accept these services, providing your consent to either the third party or to us, we may exchange your information, including your Personal Information, as well as information about how you interact with each company's service or product.  This exchange of information is necessary to maintain business operations and to provide the ongoing service you've requested.  By requesting or accepting these products or services, you are permitting us to provide your information, including your Personal Information, to the other party.
