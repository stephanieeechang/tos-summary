**About IP Addresses**  
PlasmaNet Intl Limited collects IP addresses along with web stats and traffic sources, which does not personally identify our users, to administer the site, analyze site usage/trends, and report aggregate information to our advertisers. This information is also used in your welcome email to confirm that in fact you have registered for FreeLotto and will be used in the event that you dispute registration. In some cases an IP address is specific to your computer. In other cases an IP address is randomly assigned with a block of IP addresses which are assigned by your ISP (internet service provider) every time you log on. 

An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your ISP server. Web servers - the big computers that "serve" up Web pages - automatically identify your ISP by its IP address. 

When players request pages from PlasmaNet Intl Limited websites, our servers log and record the players' IP addresses. 

**Cookies - The PlasmaNet Intl Limited Online Cookies Policy**  


We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our Service and we hold certain information.

What are cookies? Cookies are small pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your registration, passwords, and references while you're on our site. The use of cookies is an industry standard - you'll find them at most major Web sites. 

By "looking" for a cookie our server can determine whether or not you have already registered to play. Cookies help our server to know you are playing, so that you don't need to register each time you play. 

Cookies also help us to serve you better. Through the use of cookies we can better understand what information interests you, providing more of what you like and want from FreeLotto® and our advertisers. 

You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service.
