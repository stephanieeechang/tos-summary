### PRIVACY POLICY

This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for NYDailyNews.com and any other affiliated sites, digital services, or applications on which a link to this Privacy Policy appears (collectively, the “Daily News Services”). This Privacy Policy governs the use and collection of information collected from you on the Daily News Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information you may provide to us offline or through any means other than the Daily News Services, other than as specifically identified below. For example, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information you may have provided when obtaining a home delivery subscription offline or when entering a sweepstakes by mail, fax or email. As used herein, “we,” “us” and “our” refers to Daily News, L.P.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our online privacy practices. In addition, please review our [Terms of Service](http://www.nydailynews.com/services/terms-services), which also govern your use of the Daily News Services and which incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference.

This Privacy Policy may be modified at any time and from time to time; the date of the most recent revision will appear on this page so check back periodically. You agree that your use of the Daily News Services is subject to this Privacy Policy as then in effect. Continued access to the Daily News Services by you following any modification in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of this Privacy Policy as modified. _If you do not agree to be bound by all of the terms set forth below, do not use any Daily News Services._

### I. What Information Is Collected?

#### A. Personally Identifying Information

To take advantage of certain optional features or functions of the Daily News Services, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifying information. Personally identifying information is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally (such as your full name, address, or email address), and which we may refer to here as “PII”. For example, you may be asked to supply your name and email address if you complete the optional registration process for the Daily News Services, if you participate in a sweepstakes or contest on the Daily News Services, or if you purchase a classified ad using our online ad placement service. You can choose not to provide such information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in some features of the Daily News Services. We do not automatically collect any PII from visitors to the Daily News Services. After creating a profile on NYDailyNews.com, if you wish to change any of your profile information, you may do so by clicking the “My Profile” link when you are logged in and then edit your contact information.

_Children Under the Age of 13._ We do not knowingly collect or solicit PII from or about children under the age of 13. By submitting any PII, you certify that you are at least 13 years of age. If we discover that we have received any information from or about a child under 13 in violation of this statement, we will delete that information. If you believe that we have collected PII from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us at the address provided in the “QUESTIONS” section below.

#### B. Non-Personally Identifying Information

_Cookies._ Like many website operators, we sometimes make use of browser “cookies.” A “cookie” is a small piece of information that we use to assign each visitor’s computer a unique, random numerical identification code that resides in a designated file on your computer. Our cookies do not automatically collect PII. We may use information collected from cookies to recognize your browser when you visit the Daily News Services, to facilitate easy login, to attempt to personalize the Daily News Services for each user, to ensure that your browser does or does not see the same ad over and over again, to sequence ads and offers in a series and to track page usage and paths, to help serve advertisements, or to facilitate your ability to navigate the Daily News Services. We may link the cookie to PII you submit or other information we collect. Separately, third party companies that serve advertisements on the Daily News Services may use cookies and other tracking information, as further detailed below, to collect information about your visits to this Daily News Service and other websites. To learn more information about the practices of these third party advertising companies, click [here.](http://www.networkadvertising.org/code-enforcement)

You can configure your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set by choosing this option in the preferences or menu options in your browser. However, if you disable cookies, you may not be able to use certain optional features or functions of the Daily News Services. 

_Log Files._ Like most websites, we use tracking programs that collect information about log files, including browser types, Internet service providers (ISPs), referring/exit pages, platform types, date/time stamps, number of clicks, and Internet protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet, which web servers use to identify where to send the information your computer requests. We may use IP addresses for a number of purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business partners, or to audit the use of the Daily News Services. We may disclose such non-personally identifying information, such as aggregated statistics, to third parties for a variety of purposes, including describing our services, marketing, and improving the experiences of visitors to the Daily News Services. The information that we collect regarding log files is not linked to PII.

_Web Beacons/Web Bugs (Clear GIFs/ Single-Pixel GIFs)._ A web beacon allows the party that set the web beacon to monitor and collect certain limited information about the movements of online web users. No PII is collected through web beacons or web bugs. Advertisers on the Daily News Services may elect to use third party advertising companies to serve ads on the Daily News Services, and they may use such web beacons to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement, in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. Advertisers may also place a web beacon to allow them to recognize an existing cookie on your browser if from the same service. We do not control web beacons used by such third parties. 

### II. How is the Information Collected Used, and How Can I Opt Out?

#### A. Personally Identifying Information.

_Authorized Purposes and Special Offers._ PII that you voluntarily submit may be used for the purposes authorized when it was submitted. For example, if you submit PII to request services or content, such as a newsletter, the information that you submit may be used to fulfill your request. You may pick and choose which email newsletters you wish to receive (including not to receive any email newsletters) by clicking the “unsubscribe “ link included on the bottom of every email newsletter you receive from us. In addition, we, our advertisers, or third parties selected by us may send you special offers and information. If you do not wish to receive such special offers and information sent by email, you may follow the instructions for unsubscribing included within any of such special offers or informational emails.

_Administrative Purposes._ We may use PII you submit to contact you for internal administrative purposes such as site administration, troubleshooting, or processing of e-commerce transactions, or relating to your use of the Daily News Services or content you post on the Daily News Services, or in our discretion to notify you of major changes to the Daily News Services or this Privacy Policy.

_Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions._ If you win a sweepstakes or contest, your PII may be disclosed on a winners list as required by law. In addition, by entering a contest or sweepstakes on the Daily News Services, you consent to the use of your PII by us and our service providers providing services in connection with such sweepstakes or contest for purposes of prize fulfillment and/or for marketing, such as to notify you of a product or promotion that may be of interest to you. If you no longer wish to receive emails about products or promotions that may be of interest to you, you can always opt out of receiving further information by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link included in such emails. Please note that, if you provide your PII in order to enter one of our sweepstakes, contests or online offers, you may still receive information about the specific sweepstakes, contest or online offer you entered in order for us to fulfill your request or conduct such contest, but you will not receive such other emails about products or promotions if you opt to unsubscribe.

_Service Providers and Third Parties._ PII may be shared with third parties as disclosed in this Privacy Policy or at the time you provide your information. Third parties that provide support for the operation of the Daily News Services or features thereof may also have access to such information. We may also share PII we have about our users with third parties so that the third parties can send you information and special offers, unless you choose to opt out from such sharing by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link included in such emails. We may also combine information about our subscribers with PII you submit on the Daily News Services. We may also share your PII with third parties to accomplish the purposes for which it was submitted. For example, if you use the Daily News Services to sign up for home delivery of the print edition of the _Daily News_ , your contact information, including your address, may be shared with a third- party home delivery carrier. In all cases, however, we will use the information only as permitted by law.

#### B. Non-Personally Identifying Information
