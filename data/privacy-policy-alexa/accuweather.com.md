We use certain defined terms in this Privacy Policy. They have the following meanings: 

"AccuWeather," "We," "Our," and "Us" refers to AccuWeather, Inc. and any and all entities that are controlled by or under common control with AccuWeather, Inc. 

"AccuWeather Sites" include but are not limited to all AccuWeather wired and mobile websites, digital products, services, websites, applications, data, content, advertising, and other elements. These other elements may include sign-up screens, contests, data input and tracking, and other interfaces. 

"Online Behavioral Advertising," also referred to as "OBA," which is also sometimes called "interest-based advertising," uses information collected across multiple web sites that You visit in order to predict Your preferences and to show You advertisements that are most likely to be of interest to You. 

"Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII" means information by which a natural person can be specifically identified. This information includes things such name, address and email address. Your username and a password You supply are examples of PII. Information about a device or the location of a device may be PII, but only if We also have other information that, when combined with information about that device, might lead to identification of You or another natural person. 

"Providers," refers to non-AccuWeather entities such as, but not limited to, service providers, advertisers, vendors, data collection services and other third parties. These Providers may also collect information about You. 

"User," "You," "Your," and "Visitor," whether in the singular or plural refers to a natural person who views, downloads or interacts with any AccuWeather Sites. 

**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

We collect information, including PII, on AccuWeather Sites during the registration process and through Your use of AccuWeather Sites that We believe will allow Us to better and more efficiently serve You. 

**Information We ask You to provide.** We may ask You to provide PII or allow AccuWeather and/or its Providers to identify or contact You. We may request this information when we ask You to register for fee-based services, although some free products and services may also request or require registration. For example, We may request PII from You when You create an account, download an application or content through AccuWeather Sites, upload content (e.g., photos, videos) to AccuWeather Sites, subscribe to e-mail newsletters or other content made available by AccuWeather Sites, or report a problem with Your account or AccuWeather Sites. As a registered subscriber or user, You may be able to download software, enter contests or sweepstakes, order e-mail newsletters or participate in additional services or other promotions offered on AccuWeather Sites. 

**Information Your device provides passively about the device, the network it is on and the device's location.** Your use of AccuWeather Sites may result in the assignment of unique identifiers (IDs). Some of these IDs are generated by Your device and some of these are provided to Your device by Us or our Providers. These may be in the form or numbers or combinations of letters, numbers and other characters or other codes. These may be used to allow AccuWeather and its Providers and others who assist AccuWeather in the support of AccuWeather Sites to know Your device's location, web browsing movements or information about the environment near the device. 

When you use AccuWeather Sites, your device may send us some or all of the following: 

  * GPS Coordinates. The GPS coordinates of a device. On many devices, enabling or disabling "Location Services" or a similar setting controls whether the device sends GPS coordinates. 

  * Internet Protocol (IP) Address. An IP Address is a number automatically assigned by Your Internet Service Provider (ISP). The IP address is the host computer a device uses to connect to the ISP's network to send information to Us or to our Providers and for a device to receive information back from Us or from our Providers. 

  * Device ID. A Device ID is a combination of letters and numbers that is unique to the device You are using. The Device ID identifies the device, regardless of who is using the device. On many devices, the Device ID is provided by the device manufacturer and stored permanently in the memory of the device. Depending on how the manufacturer configured the device, You may not be able to change it. 

  * Advertising ID (AAID) or ID for Advertising (IDFA). These are combinations of letters and numbers that are unique to the device You are using. However, these identifiers may not be permanent. Depending on Your device, You may be able to reset them through the settings of Your device or Your browser. 

  * Information about other devices that are near Your device. Your device commonly has several types of wireless communications methods, and each is enabled or disabled separately by You. If You are using a wireless or cellular connection, the device may log and transmit when it has come in contact or connected to other devices or components of the network the device is using. These include things such as: 

    * When You enable WiFi, a service set identifier (SSID) of a WiFi access point near the device 
    * When You enable a cellular connection, a cell tower near the device 
    * When You enable Bluetooth, a Bluetooth beacon near the device 
  * Information from sensors on Your device. Many mobile devices include sensors that measure information about the surroundings of the device. These include things like gyroscopes, accelerometers and altimeters that measure things like rotation, speed direction and altitude. Some wearable devices also include sensors for body conditions like pulse and body temperature. 

  * Information about the performance of Your device. This may include information such as how much battery power the device is using, the operating system and version the device is using and the version of Our application the device is using. 

  * Cookies. Cookies are files with small amounts of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. If You are accessing an AccuWeather Site through a browser, including a browser on a mobile device, cookies may be sent to the browser and stored in the device's memory. This identifies the device the next time it accesses an AccuWeather Site through a browser. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if You do not permit the device to accept cookies, Your experience may not be optimal when You return to an AccuWeather Site because We may not recognize the device. You can learn more about how we use cookies [here](https://www.accuweather.com/en/cookiepolicy). 

  * Pixel Tags, Web Beacons, Flash Shared Objects/HTML5 Local Storage/HTML5 Mini Databases. Many mobile devices use these technologies which allow for the storage of information on the mobile devices and, in effect, allow the enhancement of internet browsing The Flash Shared Objects, HTML5 Local Storage and HTML5 Mini Databases also allow the device to track a user's web browsing movements across the internet and not just on one particular website. You can learn more about how we use these technologies [here](https://www.accuweather.com/en/cookiepolicy). 




If you turn off "Location Services" or a similar setting that controls GPS functionality, the device still may automatically send or receive this other information as long as you have these other communications types enabled. You should read the instructions related to Your device, operating system or browser to learn about how to control the information Your device may transmit. 

We do not respond to web browser Do Not Track signals at this time. 

**Weather observations, videos and other information You choose to upload or submit to Us.** You may have the opportunity to submit information about Yourself and your surroundings, such as weather-related data You observe, as well as your present location or another location of interest. You also may be able to post or submit photos, videos, graphics, information, comments, and other content to an AccuWeather Site. When you submit this information, it becomes the property of AccuWeather, and you accept responsibility for its accuracy, appropriateness and legality. It may be distributed and become publicly available. It may be viewed, read, collected, or used by others, outside of Our control, including any geo-location, tags, or other metadata in the submission. 

**Information about You that You choose to share through Social Media.** You may engage with Our content on or through social media services or other third-party platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and others that are integrated to an AccuWeather Site.
