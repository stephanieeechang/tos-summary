One type of persistent cookie that may be installed on your computer when you use Scribd is called a “Flash cookie” or an “LSO.” Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser's “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. For more information on how to manage Flash cookies, you can go here.
