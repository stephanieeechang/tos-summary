# Outbrain Inc. Legal Center

Much of this Privacy Policy is divided into sections based on the way you may interact with Outbrain. Please determine what user type you are. For each user type we’ve explained what information we collect and why, what cookies and other similar technologies we use, how we share such information, and your rights.

**(a) What information we collect and why**

We use UUIDs, IP Address and other Usage Information so that we can serve interesting recommendations. Outbrain’s recommendations may be paid for by an advertiser linking you to a new website or they may be organic such that the link is to another page on the same publisher’s website. 

  * _UUID._



When as a User you first visit a Partner Site (e.g., CNN.com), Outbrain drops a cookie on your device in order to generate a UUID (a Unique User Identifier). We catalog and analyze the content you consume across Partner Sites. Our recommendations are based on: (i) browsing history; (ii) similar browsing patterns of other Users; (ii) recommendations that are generally popular  with Outbrain’s audience at this time; (iv) some randomness, and (v) targeting requirements that may be provided or requested by our Amplify clients. As an example, Outbrain may know that UUID 123 (which could be you on your iPhone X on the Guardian using Chrome as your browser) likes to read about far away holiday destinations and that people who like to read about far away holiday destinations also like to read about exotic food. 

The UUID is a sequence of numbers and/or letters. This UUID attaches itself to your device and varies depending on which browser you use. In other words, Outbrain records a different UUID depending on which device and/or which browser you use when accessing the Partner Sites. For example, this means that you will have one UUID when you visit a Partner Site from your mobile phone using the browser Safari, and a different UUID when you visit a Partner Site from your iPad using the browser Safari. Outbrain will combine and consolidate a UUID from a mobile device (handheld or tablet) from a browser that then accesses an application (or vice versa) from the that same device.

Assigning a UUID allows Outbrain to associate the page views visited and clicks on Outbrain’s recommendations from such UUID – all with the goal of providing interesting recommendations.

  * _IP Address and Other Usage Information._



We collect a UUID as explained above, we also collect the following information from you: (i) IP address; (ii) User Agent data: device type (e.g., iphone) , browser type (e.g., chrome), operating system e.g iOS); (iii) the pages visited; (iv) the time of visit; and (v) referring URLs and other information normally transmitted in HTTP requests . ****

The above statistical information provides us with information about how many Users visited a specific page on our Partner Sites on which the Outbrain widget is installed, how long each User stayed on that page, the type of content on that page they clicked on and how they generally engaged with that page. This information is only personal data when it is associated to a UUID.

**(b) What cookies and other similar technologies we use**

Please see this [Cookie Table ](https://www.outbrain.com/legal/privacy#cookies)under “Users” for a detailed list of the first party cookies we use when you interact with Partner Sites where the Outbrain technology is implemented.

If you click on a link to one of our recommendations, the Amplify advertiser sponsoring the recommendation may place cookies on your device through redirects prior to arriving on the destination page of the recommendations or upon reaching the destination page. In such cases you will be subject to that advertiser’s privacy policy.

In addition to Outbrain’s visible widget on Partner Sites, certain Outbrain advertisers may implement the Outbrain pixel on their websites. The Outbrain pixel determines whether the user reaching the page where the pixel is installed has an Outbrain UUID. If there is a UUID associated with such end user, Outbrain allows advertisers to retarget those UUIDs and/or provides advertisers with the total number of UUIDs that reached such page. If there was no Outbrain UUID on the page, the Outbrain pixel does not collect any information about the user.

We encourage advertisers to disclose use of the Outbrain pixel on their own websites. Outbrain does not combine pixel information with a UUID’s profile.

Data points such as page views and clicks are connected to a particular UUID are retained for 13 months. For example, if UUID 123 read an article on December 31, 2017, on February 1, 2018 that article will no longer be part of UUID 123’s profile.

**(c) How we may share information**

Outbrain does not share User profiles with any third parties. However, we may share the UUID with certain partners for the purpose of cookie syncing, or based on technical requirements. Also see the Sharing section of this Privacy Policy.

**(d) Your rights**

  * _Outbrain Opt Out._



You may opt out of Outbrain’s personalized recommendations at any time. Please see Outbrain’s [Interest Profile](https://my.outbrain.com/recommendations-settings/home) for a general visualization the data Outbrain knows about you and may use to make its recommendations. The  Interest Profile  also gives you the ability to **opt out** of personalized recommendations. Note that opting out of browsers is through the Outbrain  [Interest Profile](https://my.outbrain.com/recommendations-settings/home) , but opting out of personalized recommendations in applications is through the settings on your device (examples of steps are in the  [Interest Profile](https://my.outbrain.com/recommendations-settings/home) ).

**IMPORTANT –** even though you have opted out of Outbrain:

  * **You will still see Outbrain recommendations.** Opting out of Outbrain personalization tracking does not mean you will no longer receive recommendations from Outbrain. Instead, it means that Outbrain’s recommendations will not be personalized. The recommendations will still use information about the document you are viewing (i.e., contextual information) to provide you recommendations on that page.
  * **The opt out is cookie based and device/browser** specific. If you browse the web from several devices and/or browsers, you will need to opt out from each device and/or browser to ensure that we prevent personalization tracking on all of them. For the same reason, if you buy a new device, change browsers or delete (or clear) the opt out cookie, you will need to opt-out again. Opting out of personalization tracking is not the same as blocking cookies.
  * **To ensure deletion of the profile tied to your UUID, do not opt in to Outbrain for at least 21 days.** Your opt out from Outbrain’s personalized recommendations is effective immediately. However, if your browser permits local storage and you opt into Outbrain’s personalized recommendations within 21 days of your opt out, it is possible your prior profile will be reconnected to your UUID. If you do not opt in within 21 days, your profile will be deleted and cannot be recovered.
  * As with most opt out cookies, the Outbrain browser opt out relies upon a cookie. The opt-out cookie is intended to be persistent to honor the user’s preferences. However, the "Intelligent Tracking Prevention" feature in iOS11 may impact the persistence of cookies across websites post a 24 hour window. We suggest using another browser or considering blocking all 3rd party cookies from the browser so that you are "opted out" without needing to rely on any company's actual opt out methodology.


  * _Additional Opt-Out Options_.



You may also opt out of receiving personalized ads served by us or other advertising companies through industry powered tools such as the NAI or the various DAA-based pages (DAA,  <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>; DAAC, [www.youradchoices.ca/choices](http://www.youradchoices.ca/choices) , and/or EDAA [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)) . Visiting the NAI, DAA, DAAC, or EDAA consumer choice pages allows you to opt out of all some or all of the participating members’ services. Like Outbrain’s opt out, these opt outs do not mean you will no longer receive any advertising – the advertisements will just not be tailored to you. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the DAA, DAAC or EDAA consumer choice pages, your opt out may not be effective.

_• Lawful Basis_. __ Outbrain’s lawful basis for processing a User’s personal data is based on the lawful basis determined by each of our Partner Sites. Each Partner Site will rely on consent or legitimate interest. Please consult the applicable Partner Sites’ privacy policy for more information about their lawful basis. If a Partner is relying on consent, Outbrain will not drop a cookie on you if you have not provided consent on such Partner Site.
