# Privacy Policy - Jimdo

We, the Jimdo GmbH (hereinafter referred to as “Jimdo” or “we”) via this Privacy Policy wish to hereby inform Jimdo users and visitors of our websites as to the purpose, type and extent of the processing of personal information. The responsible body for this data processing within the meaning of the European General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) is the Jimdo GmbH, Stresemannstrasse 375, 22761 Hamburg, Germany (privacy@jimdo.com).

Our websites and services are constantly being revised and improved. Corresponding thereto, this Privacy Policy shall regularly be revised and updated. This applies in particular to those procedures used by us to carry out usage analysis, as well as those used to measure the effectiveness of advertising methods and comparable services, in particular those belonging to third parties. The current status of each of these services can be found in the tabulation located at the end of this Privacy Policy statement.

We would also like to note the following as regards to the usage of service providers located outside of the European Union: Jimdo is a service that is offered internationally. Thus, it extends not only beyond the federal republic of Germany, but also beyond the European Union. We operate worldwide and our users are scattered across this planet. Generally we give priority to European service providers when selecting particular services and service offerings, especially where such providers can deliver the required services at a comparable and competitive price and service level. However, we also wish to be completely transparent. For many of the services that we use there is simply no comparable, acceptable alternative. As a result we therefore employ the use of a range of service providers outside the European Union, in particular from the USA. We take steps to ensure that measures according to European Data Protection law are taken and applied so as to guarantee an adequate level of data protection.

## Usage of Personal Data

We collect, process and use personal data (in accordance with the definitions of the German Federal Data Processing Law) and the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in order to provide our services. The promotion of our products and provision of information as regards product functions etc. to Jimdo Users as well as other interested parties is a natural component thereof. The scope of the processing of the personal data concerned depends on whether our websites are merely being visited or alternatively being used by a Jimdo User or more specifically if a registration as a user takes place.

### Children’s Privacy

Our websites are generally accessible websites and not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from users who are considered to be children under their respective national laws.

## The processing of personal data

This includes the following cases:

  * to ensure access to and use of our Services (including billing), in particular to post advertisements and other User Content, and to measure and improve the quality and success of our Services, to keep our Services secure and operational and to adapt the content of the website and services to what Jimdo users might like based on the actions taken by the Jimdo user;

We have introduced appropriate controls, in order to reconcile our interests with the rights of the Jimdo user. On this basis, we use the data as follows:

Legal basis: Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR

## Sign-in with Facebook and Google+

### Facebook Connect

If a Jimdo user has a Facebook profile, they can visit our website to create a user account or to register using the social plugin "Facebook Connect" of the social network Facebook, published by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA ("Facebook"), under the so-called single sign-on technique.

### Google+

### The Data Processing via Single Sign-On

When the page visitor visits a page of our website that contains such a plugin, his browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook or the Google+ servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted by Facebook or Google+ directly to the browser and integrated into the page. Through this integration, Facebook or Google+ receives the information that the browser has accessed the corresponding page of our website, even if the visitor / user does not have a Facebook or Google+ profile or is currently not logged in to those profiles. This information (including the IP address) is transmitted by the browser directly to a Facebook or Google+ server in the USA and stored there.

**Legal Basis:**  
These data processing operations are carried out in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR based on the legitimate interest of Facebook or Google+ in the display of personalized advertising based on the surfing behavior.

Jimdo shall receive access to the general and public accessible information stored in the respective Facebook/Google+ profile(depending on the personal data settings of the user’s Facebook/Google+ profile), if the user, prior to the registration process provides their express consent to Facebook/Google+, in accordance with Article 6(1) (a) GDPR. This information can include the user ID, name, profile picture and age.

The data provided by Facebook/Google+ are stored and processed by us to create a user account for the Jimdo user. We only use the data that are necessary to create a user account and only if they have been released by the user via Facebook/Google+. This can include a salutation, first name, last name, address data, country, email address. Conversely, based on the user’s Facebook/Google+ profile, consent, data (such as information about browsing or buying behavior) may be transmitted by us to Facebook/Google+. Where the user deletes this data or removes permission for Jimdo to receive this data via Facebook or Google+, Jimdo shall immediately block the webpage that has been created with the data and in accordance with the deletion note below, delete the data where no statutory obligations prevent the deletion.

Facebook Inc. and Google LLC participate in and have both certified their compliance with the EU-U.S. [Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome) Framework. The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook/Google+ as well as the related rights and setting options for the protection of privacy can be found in Facebook's Privacy Policy / or in the [Google+ Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

If the user does not want Facebook/Google+ to directly associate the data collected via our website with their Facebook/Google+ profile, they must first log out of Facebook/Google+ before visiting our website. The visitor can completely prevent the loading of the Facebook/Google+ plugins with add-ons for the browser, e.g. with "[Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/)".

## Information (Log-Information) regarding the Use of a Jimdo Website

When users are logged into their Jimdo website, the Jimdo server automatically collects and composes an activity log which logs the general way in which Jimdo is used. This log includes information regarding the activity (including used storage space, number of logins, etc.), statistical data (such as e.g. browser type, date and time of access, cookies id and referrer URL) as well as the IP address of the Jimdo-user. However, it does not track what changes have been made to a Jimdo page. For example, when and where content has been created, modified or deleted on the website.

Based on the legitimate interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer, as well as in analyzing user behavior in order to optimize both the Jimdo website and the Jimdo advertising, as well as where necessary, based on explicit consent Jimdo uses the following online marketing services.

## Jimdo uses the following online marketing services.

### [Facebook Custom Audience via Facebook Pixel](https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-pixel)

Jimdo uses the so-called "Facebook Pixel" on [www.jimdo.com](http://www.jimdo.com/) websites. “Facebook Pixel” is a product of the social network Facebook.

In the case of explicit consent (via Facebook settings), this may track the behavior of users after they have seen or clicked on a Facebook ad. This process is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes and may help to optimize future advertising efforts.

The data collected is anonymous to Jimdo, and Jimdo cannot determine the identity of the users. The data is however stored and processed by Facebook, so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible and Facebook can use the data for its own advertising purposes, according to the Facebook privacy policy and the Facebook user’s profile settings (). To disable the third-party cookie set by Facebook pixel visit the Digital Advertising Alliance website: <https://www.aboutads.info/choices>

### [Google AdWords](https://adwords.google.com/home/) and [Google AdWords Remarketing](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2453998?hl=en)

Jimdo uses Google AdWords, an analytics service provided by Google, and Google AdWords, conversion tracking, as well as Google AdWords Remarketing on our [www.jimdo.com](http://www.jimdo.com/) website.

Google AdWords stores a cookie for conversion tracking on the computer's hard drive (so-called "conversion cookie") when the site visitor clicks on a Google-served ad. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. When certain pages are visited on our website, Google and Jimdo may recognize that the page visitor has clicked on the ad and has been redirected to this page.

The information obtained through the conversion cookies is used to generate statistics for AdWords customers who use conversion tracking. These statistics tell us the total number of users who clicked on the ad served by Google and viewed a page with a conversion tracking tag. More information about Google AdWords Terms of Service and Privacy can be found [here](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads).

With Google AdWords Remarketing, Google sets a cookie in the terminal's browser, which automatically enables interest-based advertising by means of a pseudonymous cookie ID and based on the pages visited by the Jimdo user / page visitor. If the user has consented to sharing his web history with Google, then Google can use the history of the visit to the Jimdo website, along with the Google analytics data and the Google AdWords data in order to create targeted audiences for cross device remarketing. The user can permanently disable the setting of such cookies by installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: <https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/>

### Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick

Jimdo also uses the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick from the provider Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

This feature allows the Google Analytics remarketing ad groups described above, to be linked to the cross-device features of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. In this way, interest-based, personalized advertising messages that have been adapted to the particular user based on their previous usage and browsing behavior on one terminal (e.g., cell phone) may also be displayed on another user's terminal (e.g., tablet or PC).

Once the user has given their consent, Google links the web and app browsing history to the corresponding Google account for this purpose. In this way, the same personalized advertising messages can be displayed on each device on which the user logs on with his Google Account. To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users who are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion. The site visitor can permanently object to cross-device remarketing / targeting by disabling personalized ads in their Google Account: <https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/>. If the site visitor wishes to object to Google's general tracking process, the conversion tracking cookies can be disabled by setting the browser to block cookies from the domain [www.googleadservices.com:](http://www.googleadservices.com/) <https://www.google.de/settings/ads>.

The aggregation of the collected data in the Google account of the site visitor takes place exclusively on the basis of his consent, which he can give or revoke on Google (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). For data collection operations that are not merged into the user’s Google Account (for example, because they do not have a Google Account or have objected to the merge), the collection of data is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The legitimate interest arises from the fact that Jimdo has an interest in the anonymous analysis of the website visitors for advertising purposes.

For more information and privacy policy, see the Google Privacy Policy at: <https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads>.

### Google Signals

On the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, we use the web analysis service, Google Signals. Via Google Signals, Google provides us with reports on cross-device user numbers, as well as different groups of users, based on different device combinations. In order to do so Google uses the data of users who have activated the option “personalized advertising” in their Google account settings. Google Signals can only be used with activated IP anonymization. As a result, your IP address will be abbreviated by Google within the member states of the European Union or in other states that have ratified the Convention on the European Economic Area prior to its transmission to the United States. Thus, no conclusions can be drawn as to the identity of a single user. You can object to the collection of your data via Google Signals, at any time via disabling “personalised advertising” in your Google Account: <https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en> Additional information on how Google handles personal data in its advertising network can be found here: [Advertising and Privacy](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)

The Jimdo website uses Bing Ads technology to collect and store data that is used to create usage profiles using pseudonyms. This service enables us to track user activity on our website when it has reached our website via advertisements from Bing Ads. If the page visitor reaches our website via such an ad, a cookie is set on their computer. On our website a Bing UET tag is integrated. This is a code used to store some non-personally identifiable information about the use of the website in connection with the cookie. This includes, among other things, the length of time spent on the website, which areas of the website were accessed, and which advertisements have reached the website. Information on the identity of the respective site visitor, as well as forms for entering personal data are not recorded.

The collected information is transmitted to Microsoft servers in the USA and stored there for a maximum of 180 days. The collection of the data generated by the cookie and related to the use of the website as well as the processing of this data can be prevented by deactivating the setting of cookies by the site visitor in their browser.

In addition, based on the user’s preferences Microsoft may be able to track usage behavior across multiple electronic devices through cross-device tracking, enabling it to display personalized advertising on or in Microsoft websites and apps. This behavior can be disabled by the site visitor at <https://choice.microsoft.com/en-us/opt-out>.

### Chat-Support System

In the administrative areas of Jimdo Websites (CMS), chat content is collected and stored for the purpose of providing customer support. The chat function provided in the CMS allows the Jimdo user to connect with Jimdo. We collect, process and use the information communicated by the Jimdo user via the chat function for the processing of the specific request i.e. in order to provide customer support. Cookies are used to operate the chat feature. The cookies make it possible to recognize the site visitor's Internet browser in order to distinguish the individual users from the chat function of our website. If the information collected in this way has a personal reference, the processing will be carried out in accordance with Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR based on our legitimate interest in effective customer care and the statistical analysis of user behavior for optimization purposes.

### Newsletter and Newsletter Performance

The Jimdo newsletters are sent via the service provider "Braze Inc", a newsletter shipping platform from the US provider Braze, Inc.located at 318 West 39th Street, 5th Floor New York, NY 10018, USA. Braze Inc has Privacy Shield certification, which provides a guarantee that they will comply with European data protection standards. Furthermore, Jimdo has also entered into a Data Processing Agreement including Standard Contractual Clauses, with Braze. The Braze Privacy Policy can be viewed at any time under: <https://www.braze.com/privacy/>

The legal basis for the use of the service provider Braze, is that of valid consent (Article 6 (1)(a) GDPR). Braze can use the data of the recipients in pseudonymous form only, i.e. without assignment to a specific user, in order to optimize or improve their own services, e.g. for the technical optimization of the sending and the presentation of the newsletter or for statistical purposes. However, Braze is not permitted to use the data of our newsletter recipients in order to contact them themselves, nor are they permitted to pass this data on to third parties.

_Newsletter Performance:_  
Our newsletters contain so-called "web-beacons", i.e. pixel-sized files that are retrieved from our server or when used, from the Server of the relevant service provider, Braze or Litmus, when opening the newsletter. As part of this process, technical information, such as information about the browser and the system used, as well as the IP address and time of the retrieval are collected. This information is used to improve the technical performance of the newsletter services based on the technical data or the target groups and the reading behavior based on the Subscriber's access location (which can be determined with the help of the IP address) or the access times. The Statistical data collected also includes determining if the newsletters is opened, when they are opened, how long they are opened for and which links are clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our goal nor, if used, that of the newsletter service provider, to observe individual users. These evaluations serve rather to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to their preferences or to send them more suitable content in accordance with their interests.

_Unsubscribing:_  
The processing of the data entered into the newsletter application form is based solely on consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). The consent provided can be revoked at any time by the Jimdo newsletter subscriber, for example via the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of each newsletter or via the checkbox in the Login area of the user’s account. The legality of the data processing that has already taken place shall remain unaffected by the revocation of the user’s consent.

The data provided to Jimdo by the Jimdo newsletter subscriber for the purposes of sending the newsletter will be stored by Jimdo, until the newsletter Subscriber is removed from the newsletter list, and shall be deleted after the newsletter Subscriber has been unsubscribed. Data that has been stored for other purposes with us (such as e-mail addresses for the Jimdo User’s login area) shall remain unaffected by this deletion.

### Hosting of the Jimdo Blog Page

Jimdo (or more specifically the web space provider for the Jimdo Blog website, WP Engine) collects data about every access to the blog pages (so-called server log files). Access data includes:

Name of the retrieved web page, file, date and time of retrieval, amount of data transferred, notification of successful retrieval, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page), IP address and the requesting provider.

The provider uses the log data for statistical evaluations only with the purpose being the operation, security and optimization of the Blog page. However, the provider reserves the right to subsequently review the log data if, on the basis of concrete evidence, the legitimate suspicion of unlawful use exists. The [privacy policy of WP-Engine](https://wpengine.com/legal/privacy/) can be viewed here.

Based on our legitimate interests in an efficient, secure and user-friendly commentary system for our blog pages we use the comment management service DISQUS.

In order to use the DISQUS features, users can log in using their own DISQUS user account or existing social media accounts (e.g., OpenID, Facebook, Twitter, or Google). Here, the user credentials are obtained from the platforms through DISQUS. It is also possible to use the DISQUS comment feature as a guest without creating or using user accounts with DISQUS or any of the social media providers listed.

Jimdo embeds DISQUS with its features on our Jimdo Blog, “8 days”. However, users enter into a direct contractual relationship with DISQUS, in which DISQUS processes users' comments and acts as point of contact for any deletion of users' data. Please refer to the DISQUS privacy policy: <https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy> in which DISQUS informs users that they save the comment content, as well as store the IP address of the commenter and the timestamp of submission. Disqus also saves cookies on users' computers and may use them to display advertising. However, users may object to the processing of their data to display ads:

Jimdo reserves the right to delete comments if their content violates the Jimdo Terms of Service. In addition, we reserve the right to stop or remove the comment function and the associated comments on any article, at any time.

## Access and Publicly Available Information

### The Jimdo Website:

All information posted on the Jimdo website of a Jimdo user may, in principle, be accessed by other Internet users e.g. when it is published by the Jimdo user on the Jimdo user’s website. Therefore, the publication of personal information (eg addresses, telephone numbers) and sensitive data (e.g. passwords, access data) should be handled carefully and prudently. Hidden subpages and password-protected areas do not provide absolute protection against unauthorized access; The same applies to uploaded files, as these may be accessible via direct links.

### Administrative Access to your Jimdo Website:

As part of our customer service and error tracing, our employees also have access to the administrative area of Jimdo Websites (CMS) on an ad hoc basis. Administrative access is to be understood as insight into all areas of the corresponding Jimdo website, including the password-protected areas. All our employees are regularly trained in data protection and are under an obligation to maintain confidentiality.

### Encryption

For the encryption (HTTPS over TLS) of Jimdo websites of the Jimdo user we use the free service "[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)". Through the certificates, we can offer a so-called transport encryption, which protects the communication to a Jimdo website from access by unauthorized third parties.

### Rights of the Data Subjects

(i.e. Jimdo user or Jimdo Site Visitor, hereinafter referred to collectively as “Jimdo user”)

According to the relevant legislation, including the GDPR, the Jimdo user and site visitors have certain rights in relation to their personal data that is processed by Jimdo. In particular, they have a right to information, correction, transferability or [deletion](https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-17-right-to-erasure-'right-to-be-forgotten'-GDPR.htm) of their data. The Jimdo user also has the right to object to certain processing of their data.

In some cases, it will not be possible to change or remove content after it has been published on the Jimdo website. Upon receipt of such request, Jimdo may close the corresponding Jimdo Account and remove the offending personal information from public areas as soon as possible based on account activity and applicable law. The legal right to information, correction or deletion of personal data remains unaffected.

### [Information](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-13-gdpr/) and [Access](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/)

The Jimdo user can usually access, verify and edit their personal information in their Jimdo account by logging in and directly updating or deleting the appropriate information.

We are happy to inform you, which personal data we have stored on you, as well as any fees incurred under applicable law. The information will be processed by us immediately and is usually sent via email. In order to receive detailed information, please inform us as far as possible as to the type of personal data requested. To be sure that the requesting person is also the person whom they claim to be, we require proof of identity. This can be a copy of an official identity document. Please ensure that serial numbers, passport numbers or similar are blackened out or removed. We use this copy solely for identification and processing of the request and delete it as soon as it has served its purpose.

### Right to Object

Insofar as the Jimdo user’s or site visitor’s data is collected on the basis of Jimdo’s legitimate interests (Article 6(1) (f) GDPR, the Jimdo user/site visitor may object to the future processing of their data in accordance with Article 21 GDPR at any time, for the future. The objection may in particular be expressed against processing for direct marketing purposes(via sending an email to [privacy@jimdo.com](mailto:privacy@jimdo.com) or unsubscribing directly from such communications via the unsubscribe link in every mail). A corresponding note as regards the Jimdo Newsletter unsubscription process can be found in every newsletter email.

If the Jimdo user makes use of his right to object, Jimdo will stop the processing of the data concerned. However, further processing is reserved if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate reasons for the processing that outweighs the interests of the Jimdo user, their fundamental rights and freedoms, or if the processing serves the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims. If Jimdo is asked to cease all or any part of the processing of the personal information, or if the Jimdo user revokes his consent (if any) to the use or disclosure of their personal information for purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, Jimdo may cease to be able to provide all Jimdo services to the Jimdo user.

The Jimdo user also has the right to object to the processing personal data that is used for statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89 (1) GDPR for reasons that arise from their particular situation via a simple email to that effect sent to privacy@jimdo.com.

### Right to Data Portability

### Exercising your Rights

Where the Jimdo User exercises his or her legal right to access, correction or deletion of their personal information, Jimdo may, under certain circumstances in particular where legally obliged to so, refuse to provide such information or refuse to correct or delete your personal information. However, Jimdo will give the reasons in these cases.

Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, the Jimdo user has the right to lodge a complaint with a relevant supervisory authority in accordance with Article 77 GDPR, in particular in the Member State of the user’s place of residence, place of work or place of alleged infringement, if the Jimdo user is of the opinion that the processing of his personal data has not occurred in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR.

### Data Security

The Jimdo User's information is protected by the Jimdo technical and organizational security measures to minimize risks associated with their loss, misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure and alteration of their and all users data. For example, we use firewalls and data encryption, as well as physical access restrictions for our data centers and data access authorization controls.
