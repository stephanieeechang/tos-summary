We share your personal information with unaffiliated entities (companies outside the Lowe's family) with your proper implied or express consent. Specifically, we share your personal information to conduct business with service providers and business partners, comply with legal requirements and transfer our business. 

### Service Providers and Business Partners

We may disclose your personal information to companies that provide various services to us in areas, such as installation, repair, warranty, order processing and fulfillment, information technology, marketing, customer service, data analytics, research and enhancement, fraud prevention, legal, compliance and risk management. These companies may need access to information about you in order to perform their functions but are generally not authorized to use the information we disclose to them for any other purpose. 

In limited cases, we may disclose information about you to a third party who may also use the information for their own specific purposes. For instance, we may provide your information to a supplier in connection with product warranty or safety issues, with a business partner who is jointly providing or promoting a product or service to you, or with a social media or online advertising technology company to serve tailored commercial information to you. 

### Legal, Enforcement, Security and Investigation

## How We Protect Information

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed and intended to protect personal information against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.

Information we collect and use may be transferred, stored and accessed globally to support our operations. We retain information for as long as it is needed or useful to provide and improve our 8 products and services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. 

## How to Exercise Your Privacy Choices

## Other Important Considerations

### Do Not Track

We do not process or respond to “Do Not Track" signals from your browser or other mechanisms that enable consumer choice regarding the collection of personal information about one's online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. 

### Cookies and Other Technologies

Cookies refer to small packets of data that websites send to your computer or other internetconnected devices. Lowe's and our business partners use them for different purposes. These technologies can uniquely identify your browser and log information, such as your device type, 10 system and browser information, IP address, system language, location and your interactions with the site. Like other websites, we need some essential cookies for our website to function properly. We also use some functional cookies to pre-populate your log-in ID to make it easier for you, or to help us remember where you left off when you shopped, so you do not have to restart all over again. We may use browser cookies, flash cookies and other types of local storage. 

Lowe's and our business partners also use cookies with other technologies, such as tags, beacons or pixels. They allow us to count visitors to our webpages, evaluate the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or recommend relevant products and services to you when you browse social media or other websites. We think these technologies create meaningful interactions with you and are helpful, but you can let us know that you prefer otherwise by opting-out from these advertising cookies and technologies by clicking here. You can find more information and options in Interest-Based Advertising and Other Targeted Advertising section. 

We may also use third-party web analytics services in our online services, such as those of [Google Analytics](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en), to help us analyze how users use our online services. 

### Interest-Based Advertising and Other Targeted Advertising

We collect data about your activities on our websites and applications for use in providing tailored advertising, and we may share information about activities on our websites with advertising networks administered by third parties. These ad networks track your online activities over time and across websites by collecting information through automated means, and they use this information to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests. As a result, you may see certain ads on other websites based on prior activities on our websites and vice versa. We may also combine information about your online activities with your activity in a Lowe's store using our mobile applications. 

We may also utilize third-party services that may allow us to associate your prior Lowe's online or in-store transaction data, operating system, user-agent string, IP address, internet browser, installed fonts and similar information with an anonymous ID, which can then be used to target Lowe's advertising to you on other websites and online platforms. These services may use anonymous IDs that do not contain any personal information or otherwise identify you. 

To provide you with a consistent shopping experience, we may also associate various devices you utilize (e.g., smartphones, tablets and desktop computers) by using the information we collect about you. We may combine information we collect from your devices with other information we have about you, such as your Lowe's account information, your interaction with our sites, apps and services and your transaction history. 

The Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) has created guidance for online advertisers and provided a mechanism for such advertisers to comply with users' choices regarding interestbased ads. To learn more about ad networks, including how to opt-out of interest-based ads, click [here](http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/). 

### Social Media Widgets

Our online services may include social media features (e.g., a Facebook “Like" button). These features are connected to third parties and may allow such third parties to collect certain information, such as your IP address and which pages you visit on our websites. These social media features are not operated by Lowe's. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policies of the company providing the features. 

### Links to Other Websites

Our websites may link to other websites for your convenience and information. For instance, they may link to websites of product suppliers, manufacturers and service providers. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any website that we do not control and that does not point to this Privacy Statement.
