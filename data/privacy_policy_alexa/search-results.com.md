We do not control the information collection and dissemination policies of third-party companies. When you are on the Site, you may be directed to other sites that are beyond our control.

These other sites may independently collect data from or about you, solicit information from you, or place their own cookies on your computer. We are not responsible for any use of the information such third-party sites may collect. 

We also offer you access to “ co-branded “ services that are jointly provided by us and selected companies. In many cases, these co-branded services will contain the Site branding, but might not be hosted by us. You may notice that you are on a co-branded site if the pages say “ provided by Search-Results “ and/or if our standard branding is otherwise displayed on the page. In such cases, you should click on the privacy link on the page to determine which company's privacy policy applies to the information you enter on the page. Even if the page is governed by a separate privacy policy, we might be entitled to receive information about you when using that service. If you elect to provide registration information when using a co-branded service, the information you provide may be shared and/or retained by the provider of that service in accordance with its own privacy policy and terms of service. 

We encourage you to consult the privacy policies of such other companies and to contact them directly if you have any questions about their use of your information. 

### What is our policy regarding personally identifiable information from children under 13?

We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we determine that a user is under 13, we will immediately delete all information pertaining to that user. 

### Do we take security precautions to protect your information?

We have security measures in place that are designed to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access to information we collect online. We utilize both industry and proprietary standards to preserve the confidentiality of information. We seek to limit access to our users' information to employees who we believe reasonably need access to that information to provide products or services to you or in order to perform their jobs. These employees have been informed of the need to maintain the security and confidentiality of such information. Unfortunately, no security system can be 100% secure; accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that we collect online.

If you are visiting the Site from outside of the United States, your information will be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data-protection and other laws in the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your own country. Please be assured, however, that we seek to take reasonable steps to protect your privacy. By using the Site Services, you consent to the transfer of your information to our facilities and those third parties with whom we may share it as described in this Privacy Policy.
