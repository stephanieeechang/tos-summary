  * ## Our Commitment to You

We Keep Your Personal Information Strictly Confidential. We at Bebo, understand and respect that your privacy should always remain strictly under your control. It is because of this philosophy that you can be confident that the information you privately divulge to Bebo will not be accessible to people whom you have not authorized to receive it. Nor will it be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties without your consent, other than in accordance with this policy.

Bebo is not a source of unwanted communications. The Bebo Website (“Site”) and mobile application (“App”) allow users (“Users”) to create and customize avatars for use in social communications. The user’s avatar interacts with avatars created by the user’s contacts. The interaction features emotions (e.g. happy, sad), speech balloons, props (e.g. coffee mug, guitar) objects (e.g. football, skiis, book), and virtual exchanges between avatars (e.g. hug, kiss, kick) and background scenery (e.g. beach).
