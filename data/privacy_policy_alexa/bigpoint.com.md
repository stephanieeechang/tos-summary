## Range measurement

Our online service uses the “Scalable Central Measuring method” (SCM / SCMnG) from INFOline Ltd. GmbH (https://www.infonline.de) to determine statistical values for the use our offers. Anonymous measured data will be collected. For the recognition of computer systems, the SCM measurement method alternatively uses either a cookie with the ID “ioam.de”, “ivwbox.de”, a local storage object or a signature that is automatically created from different browser-transmitted information. IP addresses are only processed in anonymous form. The range measurement was developed under strict observation of data protection policies. The objective of the range measurement system is to statistically determine how intensely and by how many users a website is being used. At no point in time will individual users be identified. Their identities will always remain protected. They will receive no promotional materials via the system. For online offers that belong to the Association of the Distribution of Advertising Materials (Informationsgemeinschaft zur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbeträgern e.V., IVW – www.ivw.eu) or are a part of the German Study Group for Online Research (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Online-Forschung e.V., AGOF – www.agof.de) study, “Internet Facts,” the usage statistics will be published on a monthly basis by AGOF, the Working Group of Media Analysis (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Media-Analyse e.V., ag.ma - www.agma-mmc.de), as well as by the IVW. The results can be viewed at: http://www.agof.de, http://www.agma-mmc.de and http://www.ivw.eu. In addition to the publication of measured data, the IVW regularly checks the SCM process to make sure it stays consistent with the rules of data protection. Additional information about the SCM process can be found on the INFOnline GmbH website (https://www.infonline.de), which operates the system itself, on the AGOF’s data protection website (http://www.agof.de/datenschutz), as well as on the IVW’s data protection website (http://www.ivw.eu).

Should it come to our attention that a user is or has attempted to abuse our services, we shall also transmit collected data to the IT security provider. In this process, however, only device-specific data, and no personal data, shall be transmitted.
