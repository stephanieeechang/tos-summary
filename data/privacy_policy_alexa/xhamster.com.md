  * ## 10\. Information we transfer

Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") so the processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. 

Whenever we transfer your data outside the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: 

    1. We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. 
    2. Where we use service providers outside the EEA, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in the European Union. 
    3. Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the European Union and the US. 

We may additionally, in rare occasions, transfer your personal data to a party outside the EEA where we have your prior explicit consent to do so or where such transfer is necessary for the provision of our services to you. 

  * ## 11\. Marketing information

We may process your personal data so as to inform you about existing and/or future services that may be of interest to you by sending you periodic announcements with details on existing and/or new services and/or programs.

  * ## 12\. How long we keep your personal data for

We will only keep your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect of our relationship with you. 

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. 

Where we no longer need to process your personal data for purposes set out in this privacy policy, we will delete your personal data from our systems. However, we may keep your data for longer if we cannot delete it for legal, regulatory or technical reasons. If we do, we will make sure that your privacy is protected and that your data are only used for those purposes.

Grace period: There is a 45 day grace period before we proceed with erasure. During this Grace Period you will be allowed to restore your account. The grace period functionality allows you not to lose any important information and options by mistake. After the expiration of the grace period however, your account will be deleted. 

    4. **Right to object** : You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. If you exercise your right to object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedom or for the establishment, exercise and defense of legal claims. 

If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, then we shall stop the processing of your personal data for such purposes. 

Depending on the circumstances, we may need to restrict or cease processing your personal data altogether or, where requested, delete your personal data. Please note that if you object us processing your personal data, we may have to suspend the services we provide to you.

      3. it is not relevant any more, but you want us to keep it for use in possible legal claims; or 
      4. you have already asked us to stop using your personal data but you are waiting for us to confirm if we have legitimate grounds to use your personal data. 

Please note that if you request us to restrict processing of your personal data, we may have to suspend the services we provide to you. 

    6. **Right to portability** : Where we have requested your permission to process your personal data or you have provided us with information for the purposes of entering into a contract with us, you have the right to receive the personal data you provided to us in a portable format. You may also request us to provide it directly to a third party, if technically feasible. We are not responsible for any such third party's use of your account information, which will be governed by their agreement with you and any privacy statement they provided to you. 

If we ask for your consent to use your personal data, you can withdraw your consent at any time. Please note that in case of a withdrawal of your consent you may no longer be able to use several functionalities of our Website and our services. 

Please note that some requests to delete certain personal data will require the deletion of your account as a Member as the provision of Member accounts is inextricably linked to the use of certain personal data (e.g. your email address). Also note that it is possible that we require additional information from you in order to verify your authorization to make the request and to honor your request. 

To exercise any of your rights, or if you have any other questions about our use of your personal data, please contact us electronically by sending us an email at [help@xhamster.com](mailto:help@xhamster.com).
