You have a choice to withdraw your consent for receiving marketing or promotional materials/communication. You may contact us using the contact details found at the bottom of this privacy policy.

Therefore, you may still receive marketing or promotional materials/communication during this period of time. Please note that even if you withdraw your consent for the receipt of marketing or promotional materials, we may still contact you for other purposes in relation to the travel products and services that you hold or have subscribed to with Expedia. 

All information that we collect from you is retained in the servers of the Expedia Companies. 

_Email Communications_. We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related opportunities on our Website. One way we do this is by sending you email messages that contain information about your travel-related interests. For example, if you search for a flight to New York on our Website and have saved your itinerary or otherwise not yet booked your travel, we may send you an email message reminding you about your saved travel itinerary or about a special airfare to New York. Similarly, if you receive an email from us about New York travel and demonstrate an interest in New York hotels by affirmatively clicking on a link about New York hotels in the email, you may receive an email about New York hotel offers or other destination information. We believe these email messages will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our Website. Please note that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages in any such email we send. 

#### With whom we share your information

Expedia will take reasonable steps to protect your personal information against unauthorized disclosure. Subject to the provisions of any applicable law, your personal information may be disclosed, for the purposes listed above (where applicable), to the following:

  * _Suppliers_ , such as hotel, airline, car rental, insurance companies and activity providers, who fulfill your travel reservations. Throughout this Website, all services provided by a third-party supplier are described as such. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party travel supplier whose products you purchase through this Website. Please note that these suppliers also may separately contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you, facilitate your travel reservation, or respond to a review you may submit. 
  * _Third-party vendors who provide services or functions on our behalf_ , including banks, credit card processing, business analytics, customer service, marketing, promotions, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs, and fraud prevention. We may share your personal information with telecommunications, content or other service providers to facilitate their provision of content or services, or for interconnection, inter-operability, system operation and maintenance and billing between service providers. We may also authorize third-party vendors to collect information on our behalf, including as necessary to operate features of our Website or to facilitate the delivery of online advertising tailored to your interests. Third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose. 
  * _Business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services_ , for example financial institutions, credit card services, telecommunications providers or travel-related services, as well as commercial shops and retailers in relation to providing rewards and benefits. You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear with ours. If you choose to sign up to these optional, jointly-offered services, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with those business partners so that they can contact you directly by email or post about the products and services that you have signed up to receive. Such personal information may include your contact information as well as other information necessary to provide the travel product or service you have requested. Those third party business partners will not use your personal information for direct marketing purposes, except when permitted to do so by applicable law. However, please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners. 
  * _Referring websites_. If you were referred to this Website from another website, we may share some information about you with that referring website so that they can contact you directly by email or post about their products and services. We have not placed limitations on the referring websites use of your personal information and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any website that referred you to this Website. 
  * _Companies within our corporate family_. With your prior specific consent, we may share your personal information with our corporate affiliates in the leisure and travel sector and their respective employees. This sharing enables us to: provide you with information about products and services, both leisure- and travel-related, which might interest you; address your questions and requests in relation to your customer accounts, subscription and billing arrangements with us as well as our travel products and services; activate, deactivate, install, maintain and operate our systems and/or services. To the extent that our corporate affiliates have access to your information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy. 



We also may share your information:

  * Where required by local or foreign law in the good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable laws or legal processes. 
  * When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities covering both local and foreign investigations; and upon request from law enforcement agencies in your jurisdiction, for example in order to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of the Expedia Companies, their websites, or users of their websites; and in connection with our Terms of Use and other agreements. 
  * In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a sale of a subsidiary or a division, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of winding-up. 



We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors this Website receives or the most popular hotels and holiday destinations. This information does not contain any personal information and is used to develop content and services we hope you will find of interest and to audit the efficacy of our advertising.

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies from this Website, you will not be able to access portions of our Website. 

#### Cookies and other Web technologies

We automatically collect some information about you and your computer when you visit this Website. For example, we will collect your IP address, Web browser software (such as Firefox, Internet Explorer or Safari), and referring website. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as trips viewed and purchases made. One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help customize your user experience. 

As a member or visitor to this Website, you will be assigned a permanent cookie file on your computer's hard drive. When you access the My Trips or My Account areas of this Website, reserve or purchase travel, or use selected travel planning tools, we may require you to sign in as a member, using your Member ID and password. Once you sign in as a member, we record the Member ID and the name on the member account in the cookie file on your computer. We may also record your password in this cookie file as encrypted data if you checked the box entitled "Save this password for automatic sign-in." Your Member ID, password, and the name on your member account is stored in the cookie file as encrypted data, so no one can view the information it contains by obtaining unauthorised access to your computer. Permanent cookie files remain on your computer's hard drive until you manually delete the file. 

In addition to the above cookies, we use Local Shared Objects, also referred to as flash cookies, on our Website. These are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, such as your volume/mute settings, and in connection with animated content on our Website. Local Shared Objects are similar to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text. By themselves, they cannot do anything to or with the data on your computer. Like other cookies, they can only access personally identifiable information that you have provided on this Website, and cannot be accessed by other websites. To find out more about flash cookies or how to disable them, please click [_here_](http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html). 

This Website may also use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page. We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve Website performance. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our Website. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings. 

You may block, delete or disable cookies, Web beacons and other Web technologies by amending your browser or device settings. However, if you do disable these technologies, you may not be able to take advantage of certain features or services on our Website, including our travel services and planning tools. Disabling these technologies may also mean that you are required to re-enter account information (such as Member ID and password) on several occasions during any browsing session. For more information, please refer to your browser or device settings. 

If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at our customer care email address shown below.   


#### Display of tailored advertising/Your choices

_Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising_. The advertisements you see on this Website are served by us or by our service providers. But we also allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through _cookies and other technologies_. These third parties include (1) other Expedia Companies; (2) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our Websites; and (3) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different websites on the Internet. The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our Websites and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests. We do not permit these third parties to collect personal information about you (such as email address) on our Website, nor do we share with them any personal information about you. 

Please note that we do not have access to or control over _cookies or other technologies_ these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance, which offer a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. To learn more, please click [_here_](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) or [_here_](http://www.aboutads.info/). 

_Data collected by companies that operate cookie-based exchanges to serve you with relevant advertising_. Like other companies operating online, this Website participates in cookie-based exchanges where anonymous information is collected about your browsing behavior through cookies and other technologies and segmented into different topics of interest (such as travel). These topics of interest are then shared with third parties, including advertisers and ad networks, so they can tailor advertisements to your apparent interests. We do not share personal information (such as your email address) with these companies and we do not permit these companies to collect any such information about you on our Website. Please click [_here_](http://www.bluekai.com/registry/) to learn more about cookie-based exchanges, including how to access information about the topics of interest associated with cookies on your computer and how to decline participation in these programs. 

#### Using the mobile phone and tablet Apps (the “Mobile Apps”)

When you use our Mobile App, we collect and use information about you in the same way and for the same purposes as we do when you use this Website. 

In addition to this, we also use some other information that we collect automatically when you use our Mobile Apps. Specifically: 

  * We collect information about Mobile App functionality that you access and use. This allows us to identify those areas of the Mobile App that are of interest to our customers so that we can refine and continuously improve the Mobile App. The information we collect for this purpose does not enable us to directly identify you. 
  * Each Mobile App also sends us the device's unique device identifier (or "UID"), a sequence of numbers or characters that are unique to your mobile device. We use this only on the first opening of the Mobile App so that we can confirm to our advertising networks the number of downloads resulting from clicks on their respective ad banners and other marketing tools. 
  * When you use a Mobile App, you can choose to allow access to your current location – provided by your mobile device using GPS or similar technologies – in order to identify nearby hotels, airports, or other travel service providers. If you choose to allow access, this location data may be collected anonymously as part of search requests logged by our servers. You can switch off the Mobile App’s access to your location at any time through your phone settings menu. 
  * Each Mobile App will also send us error-reporting information in the event that it crashes or hangs. This enables us to investigate the error and to improve the stability of the Mobile App for future releases. As part of these error reports, the Mobile App sends us information about the mobile device type and version, the UID, the time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state of the application when the error occurred. We do not use this information for any purpose other than investigating and remedying the error. 



You always have the ability to control what information a Mobile App sends to us. You can exercise this control either by changing the settings of the Mobile App under its setting menu or changing the settings of your mobile device. Alternatively, you can remove the Mobile App from your mobile device entirely and access our services through our website. 

#### How we protect your information

We want you to feel confident about using this Website to make hotel and travel bookings, and we are committed to protecting the information we collect. While no website can guarantee security, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they only may do so for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption when transmitting personal information that is sensitive to you (e.g., credit card details) between your system and ours, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information. 

#### External Links

If any part of this website links you to other websites, those websites do not operate under this Privacy Policy. We recommend you examine the privacy statements posted on those other websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information. 

#### Visiting our website from outside the United States

If you are visiting our website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, but please be assured that we take steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Policy. 

#### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy in the future. We will notify you about material changes to this Privacy Policy by sending a notice to the email address you provided to us or by placing a prominent notice on our website. Any changes we may make to our Privacy Policy in the future will be posted on this page. We may contact you where appropriate. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy.

You can also contact your local data protection authority for further information or to file a complaint.

This Privacy Policy is effective as of 22 February 2018.
