# Privacy Policy | We are serious about your privacy | AVG

As the world’s most trusted antivirus software company, we aim to defend you against threats in cyberspace. To do so, we may have to collect your personal data to provide you with the best weapons and the most up-to-date security. We do not take your trust for granted so we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your personal data.

This Privacy Policy was last updated on December 19, 2019.

This General Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to products and services of Avast Software s.r.o. and its affiliates (collectively “we,” “us” or “our”).

If you live in the [European Economic Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area), the Controller of your personal data is Avast Software s.r.o., which has its principal place of business at 1737/1A Pikrtova, Prague 4, Czech Republic, 140 00.

This Privacy Policy describes how we handle and protect your personal data and the choices available to you regarding collection, process, access, and how to update, correct and delete your personal data. Additional information on our personal data practices may be provided in product settings, contractual terms, or notices provided prior to or at the time of data collection. 

Please refer to our Products Policy describing specifics of personal data processing within our products and services available on each brand’s website (Avast, AVG, CCleaner).

This Privacy Policy is intended for you if you are a user of our products and services. If you are a business partner, the privacy notice that applies to you is located here: [Business partner policy](https://www.avast.com/partner-privacy).

Personal data refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“Personal Data”). 

We may collect data or ask you to provide certain data when you visit and use our websites, products and services. The sources from which we collect Personal Data include: 

  * Data collected directly from you or your device relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“Data Subject”), and may include direct identifiers such as name, address, email address, phone number, and online or indirect identifiers such as login account number, login password, marketing preferences, social media account, payment card number, or IP address;


  * If we link other data relating to you with your Personal Data, we will treat that linked data as Personal Data; and 


  * We may also collect Personal Data from trusted third-party sources such as distributors, resellers, app stores, contact centers, and engage third parties such as marketing, survey, analytics or software suppliers to collect Personal Data to assist us.



We organize the [Personal Data we process](https://web.archive.org/privacy/#personal-data-we-process) into these basic categories: Billing Data, Account Data, and Product Data.

**Billing Data**  includes your name, email address, masked credit card number, license information and in certain circumstances, your billing address and your phone number. In most circumstances, you purchase our products and services from a trusted third-party service provider, reseller, or app store. In those circumstances, your Billing Data is processed by the relevant third party and we only receive a subset of this data to keep proper business records. In these instances, see below an example of Billing Data and what we use it for:

Any information you provide here will be visible to other users (including your total number of posts, and posts per day, the date and time you registered, your local time, and the date and time of your last activity).

**Product Data** includes two sub-categories: 

  * **Device Data**  includes information about the operating system; hardware; city/country of device; error logs; browser; network; applications running on the device, including our products; and


  * **Service Data**  includes information about our product usage and events relating to use of our product by you such as malware samples and detections, information concerning URLs of websites, usage statistics (activation, crashes, scans, errors), IP address.



These sub-categories differ for each product and service. If you want more detail about Device and Service Data we process on a product basis, please refer to our [Products Policy](https://web.archive.org/privacy/#products-policy) available on each brand’s website (Avast, AVG, CCleaner).

We use your Personal Data for the following purposes and on the following grounds:

**On the basis of fulfilling our contract**  with you or entering into a contract with you on your request, in order to:

**On the basis of legal obligations** , we process your Personal Data when it is necessary for compliance with a legal tax, accounting, anti-money laundering, legal order, or other obligation to which we are subject.

We have balanced the interests for the above mentioned processing operations. You have the right to object, on grounds relating to our particular situation, to those processing operations. For more details please see section [Your Privacy Rights](https://web.archive.org/#your-privacy-rights).

## **Balancing Legitimate Interests**

Before relying on our legitimate interests, we balanced them against your interests and made sure they are compelling enough and will not cause any unwarranted harm. With respect to the purposes below we consider necessary to explain what our interests are in detail.

### **Systems, Apps and Network Security**

We process Personal Data for network and information security purposes. In line with EU data protection law, organizations have a recognized legitimate interest in collecting and processing Personal Data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information security. This primarily covers the ability of a network or of an information system to resist events, attacks or unlawful or malicious actions that could compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted data, or the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via those networks and systems.

Both as an organization in our own right, and as a provider of cybersecurity technologies and services which may include hosted and managed cybersecurity technology services, it is necessary for the functionality of our systems, products and services and in our legitimate interests as well as in our users’, to collect and process Personal Data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring the security of our own, and of our users’ networks, devices, and information systems. This includes the development of threat intelligence resources aimed at maintaining and improving on an ongoing basis the ability of networks and systems to resist unlawful or malicious actions and other harmful events (“cyber-threats”). 

The [Personal Data we process](https://web.archive.org/privacy/#personal-data-we-process) for said purposes includes, without limitation, network traffic data related to cyber-threats such as:

  * Sender email addresses (e.g., of sources of [SPAM](https://www.avast.com/c-spam));


  * Recipient email addresses (e.g., of victims of targeted email cyberattacks including [phishing](https://www.avast.com/c-phishing));


  * Reply-to email addresses (e.g., as configured by cybercriminals sending malicious email);


  * Filenames and execution paths (e.g., of malicious or otherwise harmful executable files attached to emails);


  * URLs and associated page titles (e.g., of web pages broadcasting or hosting malicious or otherwise harmful contents); and/or


  * IP addresses (e.g., of web servers and connected devices involved in the generation, distribution, conveyance, hosting, caching or other storage of cyber-threats such as malicious or otherwise harmful contents).



Depending on the context in which such data is collected, it may contain Personal Data concerning you or any other Data Subjects. However, in such cases, we will process the data concerned only to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate to the purposes of detecting, blocking, reporting (by removing any personally identifiable elements) and mitigating the cyber-threats of concern to you, and to secure your network, device and systems. When processing Personal Data in this context, we do not seek to identify a Data Subject.

### **In-product and Email Messages**

We have a legitimate interest for messaging our users about possible security, privacy and performance improvements and products that supplement or improve purchased products.

If you are our customer, we feel a responsibility to inform you about security and utility improvements and possible problems to your device and software that go beyond our product that is installed and provide you with effective solutions relevant to these problems, which may include also our own solutions. We thus have legitimate interest to optimize the content and delivery of this type of communication to you so that you will be most likely to find them relevant and non-intrusive at the same time.

### **New Product Development**

We have a legitimate interest to use necessary Personal Data to develop new products or features so that we are able to provide you with state-of-the-art security, privacy and performance products.

### **Third-party Analytics (user acquisition, user interactions)  **

We have a legitimate interest to use necessary Personal Data for third-party analytics to understand user conversions, acquisitions and campaign performance through various distribution channels, and users’ download, activation and interactions with our products because these analytics help us maintain functionality, effectiveness, security and reliability of our products and business activities.

We do our best to disconnect or remove all direct identifiers from the Personal Data that we use:

  * For free versions, this disconnection or removal of identifiers begins when the products and services are initially activated. For paid users we keep Billing Data in a separate database and minimize its use for anything other than handling payments and our own finances. 


  * For both paid and free versions, we continuously monitor for, minimize, disconnect and remove all direct identifiers during the normal performance of the products and services.



## **Processing of IP Addresses**

For paid products including antivirus, virtual private network (“VPN”), and performance, your IP address is collected at the time at which your product or service is being provided, for the purpose of facilitating our billing process. Specifically, our third-party billing partner will collect your IP address for its billing process; we do not store the IP address from this process.

For free and paid products including antivirus, your IP address is also processed for the purpose of downloading certain products and malware detection. 

Please refer to our Products’ Policy for specific use of IP address by our products and services.

## **No Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling**

We do not take any decisions involving the use of algorithms or profiling that significantly affects you.

We only disclose your Personal Data as described below, within our group, with our partners, with service providers that process data on our behalf and with public authorities, as required by applicable law. Processing is only undertaken for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and the relevant Products Policy sections. If we disclose your Personal Data, we require its recipients to comply with adequate privacy and confidentiality requirements, and security standards.

## **Payment processors**

If you opt to pay for use of our services, we will use a third party payment processor to take payment from you. These third parties are properly regulated and authorized to handle your payment information and are prohibited from using your Personal Data for any other purposes other than arranging these services for us. However, they are independent controllers of your data with their own responsibility.

These are our long-term payment processors:

Your Billing Data is processed by the payment processor from whom you purchased the product. Your data is processed according to the relevant processor’s privacy policy. 

## **Service Providers**

We may use contractors and service providers to process your Personal Data for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and Products Privacy Policy. We contractually require service providers to keep data secure and confidential. 

Such service providers may include in particular contact centers, professional consultants (including for defence or exercise of our rights), and marketing/survey/analytics/software suppliers.

Sometimes these service providers, for example, our distributors, resellers, and app store partners, will be independent controllers of your data and their terms and conditions, end user license agreements (“EULA”) and privacy statements will apply to such relationships.

## **Advertising Companies**

To be able to offer our products and services for free, we serve third-party ads of advertising companies in our products for mobile devices. To enable the ad, we embed a software development kit (“SDK”) provided by an advertising company into the product, which then collects Personal Data in order to personalize ads for you. 

Please note that only few of our free products serve third-party ads. You will be asked for consent during the installation process of such product. For further information, including the exact scope of processed Personal Data and names of relevant products, please refer to our [Consent Policy](https://www.avg.com/consent-policy) which includes the list of our advertising partners and their privacy policy.

## **Trend Analytics**

We have partnered with our subsidiary, Jumpshot Inc., that uses stripped and de-identified data to build products and services that provide trend analytics for companies. For more information please refer to our [Consent Policy](https://www.avg.com/consent-policy).

## **Distributors, Resellers**

We may provide your Personal Data to our partners for the purpose of distribution, sale or management of our products. Our partners may use your Personal Data to communicate with you and others about our products or services. In addition, you purchase our products directly from our distributor, a reseller, or an app store. Because your relationship in these cases is with that distributor, reseller or an app store, such third party will also process your Personal Data.

## **Cookies Providers**

Our websites use cookies to personalize your experience on our sites, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, help us measure the effectiveness of campaigns, and give us insights into user interactions and user base as a whole so we can improve our communications and products. While using our websites, you will be asked to authorize the collection and use of data by cookies according to the terms of the [Cookie Policy](https://www.avg.com/privacy/#table).

## **Analytics Tool Providers**

We use analytical tools, including third-party analytical tools, which allow us to, among other things, identify potential performance or security issues with our products, improve their stability and function, understand how you use our products, and websites, so that we can optimize and improve your user experience, as well as evaluate and improve our campaigns. We use Service and Device data for analytics.

While we generally prefer using our own analytical tools, we sometimes need to partner with other parties, which have developed and provide us with their own tools and expertise. Below, we list these partners and tools and their privacy policies.

Please note that not all of our products use all of these third-party analytics tools. Analytics tolls that we use for diagnosing your product are necessary for service provision. You will find relevant tools listed under each product in our Products Policy. 

## **Public Authorities**

In certain instances, it may be necessary for us to disclose your Personal Data to public authorities or as otherwise required by applicable law. No Personal Data will be disclosed to any public authority except in response to:

  * A subpoena, warrant or other process issued by a court or other public authority of competent jurisdiction;


  * A legal process having the same consequence as a court-issued request for data, in that if we were to refuse to provide such data, it would be in breach of local law, and it or its officers, executives or employees would be subject to liability for failing to honor such legal process;


  * Where such disclosure is necessary for us to enforce its legal rights pursuant to applicable law; or


  * A request for data with the purpose of identifying and/or preventing credit card fraud.



## **Mergers, Acquisitions and Corporate Restructurings**

Like any other company, we too go through its own cycle of growth, expansion, streamlining and optimization. Its business decisions and market developments therefore affect its structure. As a result of such transactions, and for maintaining a continued relationship with you, we may transfer your Personal Data to a related affiliate.

If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your Personal Data may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you of any such deal and outline your choices in that event, when applicable.

## **Cross-Border Transfers of Personal Data among Avast Entities and to Third-Party Vendors**

We are a global business that provides its products and services all around the world. In order to reach all of our users and provide all of them with our software, we operate on an infrastructure that spans the globe. The servers that are part of this infrastructure may therefore be located in a country different than the one where you live. In some instances, these may be countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Regardless, we provide the same GDPR-level of protection to all Personal Data it processes.

At the same time, when we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA, we always make sure to put in place appropriate and suitable safeguards, such as standardized contracts approved by the European Commission or specialized regimes such as Privacy shield, which legally bind the receiving party to adhere to a high level of protection, and to ensure that your data remains safe and secure at all times and that your rights are protected.

Situations where we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA include provision of our products and services, processing of transactions and your payment details, and the provision of support services. Further, an outside-EEA transfer may also occur in case of a merger, acquisition or a restructuring, where the acquirer is located outside of the EEA (see the Mergers, Acquisitions and Restructurings section).

We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of your Personal Data.

## **Administrative Safeguards**

Access to the Personal Data of our users is limited to authorized personnel who have a legitimate need to know based on their job descriptions, for example, employees who provide technical support to end users, or who service user accounts. In the case of third-party contractors who process personal information on our behalf, similar requirements are imposed. These third parties are contractually bound by confidentiality clauses, even when they leave. Where an individual employee no longer requires access, that individual's credentials are revoked.

## **Technical Safeguards**

We store your personal information in our database using the protections described above. In addition, we utilize up-to-date [firewall](https://www.avast.com/f-firewall) protection for an additional layer of security. We use high-quality antivirus and [anti-malware](https://www.avast.com/c-malware) software, and regularly update our [virus](https://www.avast.com/c-computer-virus) definitions. Third parties who we hire to provide services and who have access to our users' data are required to implement privacy and security practices that we deem adequate.

## **Physical Safeguards**

Access to user information in our database by Internet requires using an encrypted VPN, except for email which requires user authentication. Otherwise, access is limited to our physical premises. Physical removal of Personal Data from our location is forbidden. Third-party contractors who process Personal Data on our behalf agree to provide reasonable physical safeguards.

## **Proportionality**

We strive to collect no more Personal Data from you than is required by the purpose for which we collect it. This, in turn, helps reduce the total risk of harm should data loss or a breach in security occur: the less data we collect, the smaller the overall risk.

We have products and services designed specifically to assist you as a parent by providing child online protection features. In such cases, we will only collect and process Personal Data related to any child under 13 years of age, which you choose to disclose to us or otherwise instruct us to collect and process. Details about this processing is included in our Products Policy. Please refer to the specific applicable notices for this information.

We will hold your Personal Data on our systems for the following periods: 

  * For Billing Data, for as long as we have a legal obligation or for our legitimate interests in establishing legal rights; 


  * For Account Data, for as long as you maintain your account; 


  * For Product Data, only as long as necessary for the purposes of a particular product or service. We use rolling deletion periods which means we regularly delete collected data in the given periods starting from the collection of that respective data. The rolling deletion periods for Product Data are not longer than six years. You can find specific rolling deletion periods for each of our products and their purposes in our Products Policy. Please note that when you uninstall our product, processing for service provision, in-product messaging, third-party analytics and third-party ads, if applicable, dependent on the installed product shall cease. After the uninstallation, we will continue to process your Product Data for statistical purposes for up to six years, however, we have appropriate measures in place, including pseudonymization. 



The data we collect from you may be stored, with risk-appropriate technical and organizational security measures applied to it, on in-house as well as third-party servers in the Czech Republic, in the United States, as well as anywhere we or our trusted service providers and partners operate. 

In all cases, we follow generally accepted standards and security measures to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. 

You have the following rights regarding the processing of your Personal Data:

  * Right to information - Right to receive information about the processing of your Personal Data, prior to processing as well as during the processing, upon request.


  * Right of access - Aside from the information about the processing of your Personal Data, you have the right to receive a copy of your Personal Data undergoing processing.


  * Right to rectification - We should process accurate Personal Data; if you discover inaccuracy, you have the right to seek rectification of inaccurate Personal Data. 


  * Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten") - You have the right to erasure of your Personal Data, but only in specific cases stipulated by law, e.g., if there is no legally recognized title on our part for further processing of your Personal Data (incl. protection of our legitimate interests and rights).


  * Right to data portability - The right to receive Personal Data which you have provided and is being processed on the basis of consent or where it is necessary for the purpose of conclusion and performance of a contract, in machine-readable format. This right applies exclusively to Personal Data which processing is carried out by automated means.


  * Right to object - Applies to cases of processing carried out in legitimate interest. You have the right to object to such processing, on grounds relating to your particular situation, and we are required to assess the processing in order to ensure compliance with all legally binding rules and applicable regulations. In case of direct marketing, we shall cease processing Personal Data for such purposes after the objection. 


  * Right to withdraw consent - In the case of processing based on your consent, as specified in our [Consent Policy](https://www.avg.com/consent-policy), you can withdraw your consent at any time, by using the same method (if technically possible) you used to provide it to us (the exact method will be described in more detail with each consent when you provide it). The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before its withdrawal.


  * Right to restriction of processing - You have the right to restriction of processing of your Personal Data if: You are contesting the accuracy of your Personal Data, for a period enabling us to verify the accuracy of your Personal Data; the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the Personal Data and request the restriction of its use instead; we no longer need the Personal Data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by you for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or you have objected to processing of your Personal Data, and there is a pending verification whether our legitimate grounds override your interests. 


  * Right to contact supervisory authority, court - You may contact and lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority – The Office for Personal Data Protection (Czech: Úřad na ochranu osobních údajů – www.uoou.cz) or your local authority or a relevant court.



The fulfillment of data subject rights listed above will depend on the category of Personal Data and the processing activity. In all cases, we strive to fulfill your request.

We will action your request within one month of receiving a request from you concerning any one of your rights as a Data Subject. Should we be inundated with requests or particularly complicated requests, the time limit may be extended to a maximum of another two months. If we fail to meet these deadlines, we would, of course, prefer that you contact us to resolve the situation informally.

Where requests we receive are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may either: (a) charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested; or (b) refuse to act on the request.

For the free versions, we do not and will not maintain, acquire or process additional information solely in order to identify the users of our free products and services. This is simply not necessary for the free versions of our products to be provided to you and function. 

This means, when you use a free version of our products and services, you may contact us with a request concerning your Personal Data. Please note, consistent with our privacy by design, privacy by default and minimization practices, we may not be able to identify you in connection with your Product Data about your specific free products and services. If such a situation occurs, please go to your product settings and explore your options. 

## **Your Choices in products**

You can make certain choices about how your data is used by us by adjusting the privacy settings of the relevant product. Please check your product settings to set your privacy preferences there.

## **Privacy Portal**

In order to make it easier for you to reach out to us and obtain the necessary information and action changes, corrections or deletions of your Personal Data, we have decided to provide you with [a portal](https://web-preview.ff.int.avast.com/www.avast.com/gdpr), which can show you the Billing Data and Account Data we have collected from you as well as your email preferences. 

## **Residents of the Russian Federation**

We collect and process Personal Data on the territory of the Russian Federation in strict compliance with the applicable laws of the Russian Federation.

We collect and process Personal Data (including sharing it with third parties) only upon the consent of the respective individuals, unless otherwise is provided for by the laws of the Russian Federation. You will be asked to grant your consent by ticking the respective box / or clicking “I accept” button or through similar mechanism prior to having access to the site, and/or when submitting or sharing the Personal Data we may request. We collect and use your Personal Data only in the context of the purposes indicated in the consent to processing of Personal Data.

We (directly or through third-party contractors specifically authorized by us) collect, record, systematize, accumulate, store, actualize (update and amend), extract Personal Data of the Russian Federation citizens with the use of databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation, except as otherwise permitted by Russian data protection legislation. We may process Personal Data of Russian citizens using databases located outside of the Russian Federation subject to compliance with Russian data protection legislation.

## **Antivirus for Desktop (Mac and Windows)**

### **Official Product Name**

[AVG AntiVirus for Mac](https://www.avg.com/en-ww/avg-antivirus-for-mac), [AVG Internet Security for Mac](https://www.avg.com/en-ww/internet-security-for-mac), [AVG Antivirus Free](https://www.avg.com/en-ww/free-antivirus-download), [AVG Internet Security](https://www.avg.com/en-ww/internet-security#pc) (collectively as “Antivirus for Desktop”)

### **Core Functionality**

The Antivirus for Desktop provides protection against malicious software by performing key tasks, such as pinpointing specific files for the detection of malwares, scheduling automatic scans, and securing your device against malware.

### **What are Product’s Main Features**

  * **CommunityIQ** is a threat monitoring service for Windows and Mac which sends information about a threat detected in your device to our server, so we can observe how the threat spreads and block it. This is vital for the functioning of our Antivirus and our ability to keep your device secure. 
  * **CyberCapture** detects and analyses rare, suspicious files on your Windows. If you attempt to run such a file, CyberCapture locks the file from your PC and sends it to our Threat Lab where it is analysed in a safe, virtual environment. All files are uploaded over an encrypted connection, which means your data is inaccessible to hackers. 
  * **File Reputation** provides a real-time comparison with up-to-date list of malware database of executable files sourced from users of Windows who agree to participate in the service. FileRep processes files or their hashed versions to evaluate which are infectious and updating virus databases. 
  * **Online Security** is a browser plug-in which needs to be specifically activated which checks if the site isn’t malicious or phishing.
  * **Browser Cleanup** is a module inside Antivirus for Desktop (Windows) which inspects the browser extensions of most browsers, tries to identify malicious extensions and offers to remove them. Browser Cleanup is on by default. You may opt-in for processing of cookie data (internal identifier (GUID), product version, time information, source browser, cookie domain, cookie name, cookie value) for trend analytics purposes, we consequently provide this data set to enable Jumpshot to build products and services. For more information please see our [Consent Policy](https://www.avg.cz/consent-policy).
  * **Web Shield** scans data that is transferred when you browse the internet in real-time to prevent malware from being downloaded and run on your computer. By default, Web Shield is configured to provide optimal protection when switched on. If Web Shield function is active and you opt-in for processing of data (internal identifier (GUID), product version, time information, stripped URLs (unless cached), carefully selected aspects of certain pages without identifiers, selected requests) for trend analytics purposes, we consequently provide this data set in a stripped and de-identified form to enable Jumpshot to build products and services. For more information please see our [Consent Policy](https://www.avg.cz/consent-policy).
  * **Antispam** is an additional feature which may be activated by you in case you want to be protected against unwanted emails (spam). The software to function must collect information contained in emails, including their content, which were reported by you as spam in order to determine whether an email is spam or not. Please note that Antispam is service of MailShell which is licensed to us, and thus it is this third party which assesses the email and makes this decision.

## **Service Data from our VPN Servers**

If you use our VPN service, we strictly collect the minimum amount of information needed to provide and operate our VPN service, as well as keep it running safely and efficiently. This is the data we collect to make sure our VPN infrastructure works (“Service Data”):

**Service data**

| 

**What we use it for**  
  
---|---  
  
Timestamps of your connections

| 

To manage the number of concurrent active connections, and handle abuse.

Example: We use them to stop brute force password [cracking](https://www.avast.com/c-cracking) attempts on user accounts.  
  
The subnet of your originating IP address.

E.g. We anonymize the last octet to protect your privacy: 92.143.234.000 We don’t collect exact IP addresses that could ID you.

| 

To plan for increased network demand and capacity.

Example: Help us decide to add servers in a region if we see a rise in demand there, or help troubleshoot issues with a specific ISP.  
  
IP address of the VPN server you’re using.

| 

To troubleshoot our service and plan for new network capacity.

Example: Identify when an IP address suddenly doesn’t work for accessing certain services, and act to resolve the issue.  
  
Amount of data transmitted

E.G. 5GB up or down

| 

To plan for new network capacity and server improvements.

Example: We may deploy more capacity to meet demand and make sure speeds stay up for all users.  
  
We store this data on servers for 30 days, after which time it is deleted on a rolling basis — so data created on Jan 3rd gets deleted on February 2nd, for example.

## **Data We Don’t Collect on our VPN Service. Period**

We do not collect, store or log any of the following data:

  * Any complete originating IP address that could identify you.
  * Any DNS queries while connected. We rely on our own secure DNS servers, so your queries are also protected from exposure to 3rd parties.
  * Any activity logs: the applications you use, the services you use, the websites you connect to — basically anything you do online.



## **Service Data from our VPN Clients**

In order to make sure our VPN clients do their job properly and improve them, we have to know how people, as a whole, interact with them. This data pertains to interactions taken in the app, and cannot be used to uncover what you’re using the VPN service for.

**Client Data**

| 

**What we use it for**  
  
---|---  
  
OS Version

E.g. [Windows 10](https://www.avast.com/windows-10-antivirus)

| 

For user support, troubleshooting, and product development planning

Example: Which platforms do our users most like to use?  
  
AVG Secure VPN version

E.G. Secure VPN for Android version 4.1

| 

For user support, troubleshooting, and product development planning

Example: Is our latest update deploying well?  
  
Application Events

E.g. Turned on auto-connection, Uninstalled, etc. You can opt out of this in the settings.

| 

To plan product development

Example: Is a new client-side feature we introduced popular? Are people uninstalling after our latest release?  
  
We delete this data on a rolling 2-year basis (i.e. data created on Jan 2, 2019, will get deleted on Jan 2, 2021).

## **Third-party Analytics In Our VPN Products**

To analyze the application events mentioned section 1.4, and understand how our services function, or how stable or successful they are, we rely on our own analytics tools as much as possible. But sometimes, we need to rely on third-party tools that address specific issues in ways we don’t have the ability to replicate. Whenever possible, we anonymize, masque, or in other ways try to limit your exposure.

Here are the third-party tools we use, how we use them, and their privacy policies. You will find that these tools are also listed under the broader section Service Data of this privacy policy which covers all our products, however in the interest of full transparency, we cover here in detail how the relevant ones are used for our VPN products:

### **Google Firebase Analytics on iOS and Android**

Firebase helps us to understand how people interact with certain aspects of our applications. While Firebase normally relies on Android Advertising ID or iOS Identifier for Advertisers, we’ve opted to use our own anonymizing identifiers instead. Therefore it doesn’t contain any information that could personally identify you. Still, you can opt out of providing us with this anonymized application performance data in our application settings.

Still, you can opt out of providing us with this anonymized application performance data in our application settings.

### **Google Fabric Crashlytics on iOS and Android**

This Google service helps us to improve the application stability, pinpoint things that don’t work, and improve your experience. Its implementation doesn’t contain any information that can personally identify you.

Both Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics are subject to [Google’s privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

### **AppsFlyer Analytics on iOS and Android**

AppsFlyer helps us understand how effective our marketing campaigns are by letting us know which ones directed you to us. The data collected here is subject to AppsFlyer’s privacy policy.

You can opt out of AppsFlyer Analytics in the settings of our applications, or by opting out by following the [instructions in their privacy policy](https://www.appsflyer.com/privacy-policy/).

### **Deprecated Analytics**

If you’re still on older versions of our applications, the following analytics are embedded in them. We highly recommend that you upgrade to later versions as they no longer use these:

  * Facebook Analytics on older versions of our Android apps: we used to use this to know how many people opened an app, how much time they spent in it, and other information about how they interacted with them. You can find [Facebook’s privacy policy here](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy).
  * HockeyApp on older versions of our macOS and iOS apps: This was used to do beta distribution, crash reporting, user metrics, feedback, and more. This tool belongs to [Microsoft and you can find their privacy policy here](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/PrivacyStatement).



## **Where We Store Your Data**

When you use our service, you may be using servers located in a variety of different countries. However, there is a difference between use and storage. What little information that gets generated by your use of our infrastructure does not get stored outside of the Czech Republic.

There may be some instances where, as a matter of necessity, we need to transfer data outside of these two jurisdictions. When we process the data within our group, regardless of where we are, we always implement the same level of data protection afforded by the European General Data Protection Regulation to all personal data we process. Where we cooperate with third parties which are involved in data processing, we legally bind any party we deal with to adhere to those high levels of protection with standardized contracts approved by the European Commission, and to ensure your rights are protected in accordance with this privacy policy.

In all cases, we follow generally accepted standards and security measures to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We always strive to protect your data to the maximum extent we can.

By using the service, you acknowledge this transfer, storing or processing.

## **How Long We Store Your Data**

Concerning storage or retention periods, the specific terms applicable to the various types of data used for various purposes are noted in their respective sections. After these periods elapse, we will delete this data and no longer use it for that specific purpose.

These retention periods may be longer where it is necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations or legal orders, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, including in the court of law.

As a rule, we do not disclose any information to other commercial parties, with the following exceptions:

## **The Avast Group**

As we are part of the Avast Group, information may be shared with members of the Avast Group in order to execute on the provisions of this service, for direct marketing, or to help our product development. In all cases, they are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## **Provision of Services**

It may be necessary to share some data with select parties to deliver the product or service you require — such as with a payment card provider who we use to process your credit card transaction, or to do perform website analytics. The information that is collected and shared with those parties is outlined above.

## **Legal Requirements**

In the event we are served with valid subpoenas, warrants, or other legal documents (for example, documents concerning the sale of all or part of our business or a merger), or where applicable law compels us to comply, or when we are required to defend the rights or property of the Avast Group, including the security of our products and services, and the personal safety, property, or other rights of our customers and employees — we may share your personal data as collected above.

## **Whatever the Circumstance**

“Avast does NOT store the originating IP addresses of our users when connected to our VPN service, and thus cannot identify users when provided the IP address of one of our servers. We are also completely unable to disclose any information about the applications people use, the services they employ, or the websites they visit while using our VPN. We simply do NOT store this information.”
