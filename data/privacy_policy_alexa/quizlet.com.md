### Our approach

Quizlet Inc. (“Quizlet”) is dedicated to helping people around the world practice and master whatever they are learning. When you share information with us we can help you achieve that goal by helping you find the right content and making your studying quicker and more effective.

  * We don't store your personal information unless it’s required for the ongoing operation of our services.
  * We give you control over how your personal information is used, including what's made visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and deleted.



## Last updated: May 25, 2018

Whether you are new to Quizlet or a long-time user, please take some time to get to know our practices. This Privacy Notice is meant to help you understand how we collect and use the personal information you provide on our website, [www.quizlet.com](https://quizlet.com/), and the two official Quizlet iOS and Android mobile applications. This Notice explains:

  * What information we collect and why we collect it.
  * How we use and share that information.
  * The choices we offer you to protect your privacy and the rights you have, including how you can access and update your information.
  * How to contact us if you have questions or concerns.



### What information we collect

We need to collect certain information about you to provide you with the Service or the support you request. The type of information we collect can vary depending on how you access and use our Service. Additionally, you can choose to voluntarily provide information to us.

#### Information you provide to us to use the Service

We collect the information you provide when you sign up for a Quizlet account, log in to your account, communicate with us, answer our surveys, upload content, or otherwise use the Services.

We request an email address and date of birth when you choose to sign up for the Service so we can provide the Services to you and allow us to comply with applicable regulations. Without this information, we are not be able to provide you with the Service.

Users who engage in financial transactions with Quizlet, for example to purchase an upgraded membership subscription, are asked to provide additional information in order to complete the transaction, such as a credit card number, billing address and full name.

Visitors can always refrain from supplying certain information, but it may prevent them from engaging in certain Quizlet services which require that information.

#### Information you provide to enhance your experience

You can choose to provide us with additional information in order to obtain a better user experience when using the Service. This additional information will be processed with your consent and/or to provide you with services you request. This information includes your survey responses, participation in contests, promotions or other marketing efforts, suggestions for improvements, referrals, or any other actions on the Service.

#### Information we get automatically when you use Quizlet

We automatically collect information about you and how you use the Service, like when you create a study set, join a class, or view and interact with your or other users’ content. This information we collect includes:

**Device information**  
Like most website operators, Quizlet collects information about how users visit our site and the devices they use. We collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, device identifiers like IDFA and UDID, and mobile network information). Quizlet may associate your device identifiers or other device information with your Quizlet Account to help us provide consistent services across your devices.

**Geolocation information**  
We may use your IP address to generate a general approximation of where you are located in order to provide you with an improved experience. We do not request access to or collect location sensor information, such as GPS or Bluetooth beacons, from your mobile device while downloading or using our mobile apps or services.

**Log information**  
When you use Quizlet, we automatically collect and store certain information about this activity. This data includes details of how you used our service, like your search queries, clicks and site navigation information, or study activity. It also may include data such as:

  * Browser type
  * Language preference and time zone
  * Referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request
  * Connection information like ISP or mobile operator
  * Internet Protocol (IP) address
  * Log-in and Log-out times



#### Information we collect from other sources

We also collect some information from other sources and combine that with information we collect from you. We do not control, supervise or respond for how the third parties providing your information process your personal data, and any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information to us should be directed to such third parties.

The information we collect about you from third parties includes:

**Facebook Connect and Google Login**  
You have the option to log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect and Google Login. These services authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us, such as your name, date of birth, and email address, to pre-populate our sign-up form. You may, optionally, choose to provide additional information during the sign-up or linking process, such as a friends list, to enable certain features on Quizlet.

**Other users**  
Quizlet may receive information about you from other users. For example, if another user chooses to use our referral service to tell a friend about our website, we may ask that user for their friend’s name and email address so we can send the invites on their behalf. You may contact us at [quizlet.com/feedback](https://quizlet.com/feedback) to request that we remove your information from our database.

**Other partners and companies**  
Quizlet may also receive information about you from other sources, including our partners, service providers or other third parties.

#### Information from Children

While Quizlet is intended for users age 13 and over, if a child requests access to our website we accommodate them by offering a limited feature set and restricted website experience that removes certain features. We offer this restricted experience (“Child Account”) for accounts of all users below the age of 13 and for some users below the age of 16 where applicable under local law.

Quizlet does not accumulate personal information about any Child Account for distribution, sharing, or selling, except as described in this Privacy Notice. To create an account, we require the user to submit a date of birth, username and email address. We collect a parent’s email address from a child under the age of consent if they attempt to register in order to notify the parent of their child’s use of Quizlet and, where required, to seek parental consent for use of that data.

We do not condition a child's participation or access to any activity on Quizlet on the child providing any personally-identifying information or any more information than is reasonably necessary for that activity.

We may use aggregated or de-identified information about children for research, analysis, marketing and other commercial purposes.

**Third Party Service Providers**  
Where necessary, we use restricted versions of our third-party services (for example, Google Analytics) that limit data sharing and tracking on areas of our site and mobile apps that are accessed by children to support our internal operations.

**Parental Rights**  
Parents and legal guardians of children under 13 can consent to collection and use of a child's personal information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to third parties.

Parents or guardians can review information their children under 13 have contributed to Quizlet by accessing their child's account via password reset. Parents can also request that Quizlet delete that information and refuse to allow Quizlet to collect further information from their children by contacting Quizlet at [support@quizlet.com](mailto:support@quizlet.com). Quizlet may ask additional questions or take other steps to verify the identity of a parent or guardian before responding to a request to review or delete a child's information or a request to refuse further collection from a child.

**With your consent**  
We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Quizlet when we have your consent to do so.

**For external processing**  
Quizlet provides personal and non-personal information to our partners, trusted organizations, vendors and other affiliated organizations to process it on our behalf.

From time to time, Quizlet may release non-personal information in the aggregate or as part of anonymized datasets, for example, by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. 

### How long we retain your information

Quizlet retains your personal information for as long as your account is active, to fulfill our legitimate business purposes, or to comply with our legal obligations. When these conditions no longer exist, Quizlet removes that information in accordance with our standard deletion processes. Quizlet may retain and use non-personal information, including information which has been de-identified, aggregated, or anonymized, indefinitely.

#### Our Process

When you delete or update your account or information, we first aim to immediately remove that data from view. We then begin the process of securely and safely deleting your personal information from our systems. We design our systems to protect information from accidental or malicious destruction, so to ensure a safe and thorough removal process, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove some information from our backup systems. In addition, things like routine maintenance, unexpected outages, bugs, or failures in our protocols may cause delays in our standard processes and timeframes, however we maintain systems designed to detect and remediate such issues.

#### Support requests and user communication

We retain records of support tickets and other communications between Quizlet and our users, for example support emails, survey responses, feedback submissions, or comments on our blogs or other posts, indefinitely in order to better manage our support processes, maintaining accurate business records, and identifying other trends. We reserve the right to publish these communications in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.

### How We Secure Your Information

The security of your personal information is important to us and Quizlet takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of personal information.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, our website and apps are protected by HTTPS encryption and when you enter credit card information on our order forms, that information is encrypted and protected by our third-party payment providers. We also maintain a robust security program including third-party testing and a bug bounty program. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at [security@quizlet.com](mailto:security@quizlet.com).

If we know or have reason to know of a systems security breach by an unauthorized party of your user data where that data is being or is likely to be used for an unauthorized purpose, we will promptly notify you so that you can take appropriate steps.

#### Data Breach Practices

We comply with relevant laws regarding data breaches. If we know or have reason to know of a systems security breach by an unauthorized party of your user data where that data is being or is likely to be used for an unauthorized purpose, we will promptly notify you and, where necessary, the relevant governmental authorities, so that you can take appropriate steps.

### Privacy Frameworks

#### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Quizlet processes your personal data only when we have a lawful basis for doing so.

In rare cases we also may be required to process your data to protect your vital interests or for a task in the public good.
