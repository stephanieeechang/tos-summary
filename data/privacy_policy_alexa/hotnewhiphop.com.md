Urbanlinx Media, Inc., and its affiliated website www.hotnewhiphop.com ("our", "us" or "we") has created this privacy policy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy. This privacy policy explaining our data collection and use practices applies to this website (the "Website"), any newsletters subscribed to via this Website, information collected and provided to us when you subscribe to or purchase any of our affiliated applications at third-party websites and applications (collectively, the "Apps"), and information collected offline when you subscribe to the print edition of Urbanlinx Magazine, but does not apply to any other products or services or to information collected in any other way (whether offline or online) by us and our respective general partners and affiliates (collectively "Urbanlinx"), unless expressly indicated by Urbanlinx (such as by including a link to this Privacy Policy on other Urbanlinx websites or on Urbanlinx mobile applications).

 **Personal and Non-Personal Information.** When using the Website on third-party websites and applications when subscribing to or purchasing an issue of the digital edition of Urbanlinx Magazine, or offline in connection with your Urbanlinx Magazine print edition subscription, which may include your name, address, e-mail address, credit card number, billing information, etc., you may be asked to provide, or you may choose to provide us with or upload, certain personally identifiable information about yourself ("Personal Information"), including but not limited to, your name, email address, physical address and telephone number.

 **Children’s Privacy.** We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 without parental consent, unless permitted by law. If we learn that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.

 **Information Usage.** Unless disclosed otherwise at the time of collection, we do not share any Personal Information you submit through our Website or the Apps with any unaffiliated third party, unless it is necessary to respond to your inquiry, or to comply with applicable law.

We may use Aggregate Information to improve and enhance the Website or the Apps, analyze trends, administer the Website or the Apps and for our market research activities. For example, we may share Aggregate Information with unaffiliated third parties, such as business partners, manufacturers, distributors and retailers, in an aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the shared information will not contain nor be linked to any Personal Information. We will never sell your Personal Information to any third party not affiliated with us without your consent except in connection with the sale or merger of our company or the division responsible for such services.

Please note that we reserve the right to access and/or disclose Personal Information and non-personal information we gather as required by courts or administrative agencies and to the extent required to permit us to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, the Website's or the Apps' rules or policies, or the rights of third parties or to investigate any suspected conduct which we deem improper.

**Anonymous Data from Google Analytics.** To help us make sure we continue to provide content that is valuable and relevant to our website visitors we have implemented the Google analytics demographics and interest reporting features on HotNewHipHop.com. These tools will allow us to review anonymous data regarding the gender, age and interests of website visitors so as to customize our content based on the profiles of our visitors. While this information will provide us with demographic information it is not provided to us in a personally-identifiable format. You can opt-out of this type of data collection using the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>

**Clickstream.** As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each Website you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data" can be collected and stored by a Website's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the Website from which you linked to the Website. We may collect and use clickstream data as a form of Aggregate Information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Website, how visitors navigate throughout the Website and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information may be used to improve our Website and our services. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and aggregate, and will not intentionally contain any Personal Information.

 **Security.** The security of your Personal Information is very important to us. We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and us, or information stored on the Website, the Apps or our servers, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers and your use of the Website or the Apps demonstrates your assumption of this risk. 

**Other websites.** Our Website may contain links to other Websites not maintained by us. Other Websites may also reference or link to our Website.

 **Changes to policy/Opt-Out Process.** We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this policy at any time. However, if at any time in the future we plan to use Personal Information in a way that differs from this policy, we will post such changes here and provide you the opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses. Your continued use of the Website or the Apps following the posting of any changes to this policy means you accept such changes. 

If you receive an unwanted email from us, you can simply reply and ask not to receive future emails. We also give you the option to remove your Personal Information from our list of active users completely. All unsubscribe or opt-out requests should be sent to us at unsubscribe[at]hotnewhiphop[dot]com and we will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt.
