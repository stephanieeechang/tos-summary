# Privacy Policy - Wall Street Journal

###### 1\. INTRODUCTION

Dow Jones & Company, Inc., and its subsidiaries ("Dow Jones") want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you because we respect your concerns about privacy, and we want to maintain your trust.

This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect from all sources, including in connection with our websites, mobile sites, applications ("apps"), widgets, conferences, events, and electronic newsletters or communications (collectively the "Dow Jones Services") that link to this Privacy Policy. If there is a conflict between this Policy and a Dow Jones Services corporate subscription agreement, the Dow Jones Services corporate subscription agreement will take precedence.

This Policy describes the types of Personal Data we collect, how we use it, and with whom we share it. It also describes generally Dow Jones' practices for handling Other Information (e.g., interests, demographics and services usage) collected through our Dow Jones Services or from a third party to the extent such information is associated with a particular device, user or user account. We also describe the measures we take to protect the information, your options for choice and access, and how you can contact us about privacy practices. As described more fully below, we share information with our subsidiaries, and affiliated companies ("Dow Jones Affiliates"), for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. A list of Dow Jones subsidiaries and Affiliates is available in annual reports accessible [here](http://investors.newscorp.com/sec.cfm). By using the Dow Jones Services, you acknowledge you have read and accept this Privacy Policy.

Your decision to use the Dow Jones Services and provide your Personal Data is voluntary. We indicate on our online, mobile, and other registration forms what types of Personal Data are requested. You may choose not to submit requested information online, or may choose to restrict the use of cookies (see Other Information below, or our [Cookie Policy](http://www.dowjones.com/about/cookies-policy/), for more information), but that may limit the services Dow Jones is able to provide to you.

The Dow Jones Services are a network of general audience sites, and are not targeted to, and do not knowingly collect Personal Data from, minors under 16 years of age. We request that these individuals do not provide Personal Data through the Dow Jones Services.

###### 2\. WHAT WE COLLECT

Dow Jones and our service providers collect Personal Data to offer services you have requested or that we have a legitimate interest to believe are of interest to our customers, to manage the relationships we have with our customers and partners, and to perform activities based on your consent. Dow Jones and our service providers may collect the following information from and about you:

#### **2.1 Personal Data**

"Personal Data" for purposes of this Privacy Policy is the information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable person.

We collect Personal Data when you submit it to us, such as when you register for or subscribe to certain products or services; create a profile; participate in a sweepstakes, contest or game; take a survey; visit our Dow Jones Services; use an interactive feature (such as chat or article sharing options); participate in a community forum; or contact customer service. The Personal Data you submit may include your name, postal address (including billing and shipping addresses), credit or debit card number, telephone number, mobile number, email address, gender, username, or profile picture.

#### 2.1.2 Personal Data We Receive From Third Parties

To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may receive Personal Data about you from third parties, such as social media services, commercially available sources, Dow Jones Affiliates, business partners, and, if applicable to you, the third party provider of your subscription. The Personal Data we receive from third parties may include your name, contact information, information about your transactions, purchase history, or relationships with various product and service providers, and your use of certain applications. For example, if you access a Dow Jones Service through a social media service or connect a Dow Jones Service to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content the social media service will share with us, such as your profile picture, or email address. The information we obtain depends on your privacy settings on the applicable social media service. When you access the Dow Jones Services through social media services or when you connect a Dow Jones Service to social media services, you are authorizing Dow Jones to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

#### **2.2 Other Information**

"Other Information" is any information that is not intended to reveal your specific identity to us, such as browser information, usage data, information collected through cookies and other technologies, demographic information, geolocation data obtained with your consent where required by applicable law, and aggregated information.

The Dow Jones Services may also be linked to sites or apps operated by third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, special offers, functionality, games or applications developed and maintained by third parties, using iframes, tools, or plug-ins (“Linked Services”). These third party Linked Services may use automated means to collect information about you and your use of these features. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a Dow Jones logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. 

Dow Jones is not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties, and once you leave the Dow Jones Services or click an advertisement, or sign up for a special offer, you should check the applicable third party privacy policy.

Some browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features which, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time.
