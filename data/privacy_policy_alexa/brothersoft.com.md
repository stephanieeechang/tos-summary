When does BrotherSoft collect personally- identifiable information?   
BrotherSoft will collect your information if the information is licensed to us, for example new released software subscription comes for users, software submission come from authors or order come from customers. We won't collect any personally- identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, phone number or email address from this web site without your knowledge, and will take measures to protect your privacy.  
  
How does BrotherSoft use the information?  
Once you licensed us provide a new released software list to you, we could send information to you via email daily, weekly or other post time. And you could easily remove your email address from our mail list.

Once you submit some software to our download library, we could offer the products information and other available information to the users. Because of complaints about spamming, that email address is no longer included on our web pages and does not go out in New Upload Digests, etc. However we simply MUST have that email address anyway. It is because we will be forwarding messages, complaints, etc. from users and audience to that address.  
And we may need to contact you about upload problems, etc. And you could easily remove your software and information from our library via email.

Once you purchase products from us, additional information will be needed to fill your order. Any information provided will NOT be sold or given to any third party(ies) by any means, and will only be used for sending the Registration Information and the Free upgrade to you via email. Besides, if you send email to us for requesting help, your email address will only be used to send replies to you.
