# Privacy Policy

Our Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used, and disclosed by Meetup. The terms “Meetup,” “we,” “us,” and “our” include Meetup Inc. and our affiliates. This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our “Platform”, which means any website, application, or service we offer, or when you communicate with us.
